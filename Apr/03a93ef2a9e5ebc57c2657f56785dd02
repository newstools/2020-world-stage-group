WorldStage NewsOnline—- The leadership of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has urged lawyers to adhere to all safety rules and regulations of government as the world celebrates Easter amidst Coronavirus pandemic. NBA President, Mr Paul Usoro in a statement assured lawyers that the trying times would be over. “It is Easter, a celebration of the life of our Lord, Jesus Christ, whose earthly life epitomised great sacrifice and love; the virtues of our Lord Jesus Christ cannot become more apt than it is at the present moment we live in. “The Coronavirus pandemic has hit us all in different ways and manners. It has changed life as we knew it. “As our frontline medical personnel are sacrificing their energy and time and in some cases their lives to fight this scourge, as citizens – particularly lawyers, we must remain responsible and abide by the directives of government.
