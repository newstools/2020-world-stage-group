Minister of Information, Culture and Tourism, Alhaji Lai Mohammed  says the Federal Government  will revive the creative industry immediately COVID-19 pandemic is over as the industry is one of the sectors of the economy mostly affected by the pandemic. Mohammed, dropped the hint at the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 daily press briefing on Thursday in Abuja. According to him, the federal government is not oblivious of the fact that the creative industry is the most hit by COVID-19 and it is already working on how the industry can be revived. He said that a list of committees that would bring back the industry to life post COVID-19 was in the offing. Mohammed said that the federal government was confident that the creative industry would resurrect, stressing that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had set aside creative industry financing, for that purpose. The minister also said that the digital switch over in broadcasting would be a panacea to the creative industry as it was capable of creating thousands of jobs in the country. “I am not under any illusion that it is not going to be very easy, but if we work with stakeholders, we will be able to achieve result,” he said.
