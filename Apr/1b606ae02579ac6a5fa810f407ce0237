WorldStage NewsOnline—  In a bid to cushion the effect of Coronavirus (COVID-19) lockdown in Enugu state,   residents on Monday appealed to the State Government to provide the vulnerable amongst them with palliatives. Some of the residents  in separate interviews said  the lockdown was the best preventive option, but demanded for what people would eat. Mr Mike Okwu, a resident of Amechi Road, Awkunanaw, said the lockdown had denied many of them means of livelihood as daily income earners. Okwu added that it was the responsibility of every government to see to the welfare of its citizens, especially the vulnerable ones in the society. Mr Jude Muoma, another resident, added that if palliatives were not provided to the citizens, some would result to stealing from others. “I am not opposing lockdown in the state, if it is what will help to eradicating the virus, but government should rise to its responsibility by making the public not to feel the effect of the continued lockdown,” Muoma said. Mrs Marbel Eboh, a resident of Achara Lay-Out, said as a hair stylist she depended on daily economic activities. Eboh added that she was tired of the lockdown as she had little or no food and money in the house. Mr Ikechi Agu, a carpenter, said it had not been easy with him staying without  income from his business for two weeks due to the lockdown. “The lockdown had brought hardship as my carpentry work is now at stand still due to Coronavirus pandemic. “At the moment, I am thinking of whom to borrow money from because the lockdown is now telling on me and my family due to lack of food in the house,” Agu cried.
