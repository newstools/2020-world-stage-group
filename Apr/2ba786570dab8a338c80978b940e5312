WorldStage NewsOnline—- Nigerians have expressed displeasure with the Ministry of Finance for openly asking Elon Musk to assist the government with 100 – 500 ventilators on Twitter, as the COVID-19 cases continue to rise in the country. The Federal Ministry of Finance made the request via its Twitter handle on Wednesday. The Federal Ministry of Finance in a tweet said: “Dear @elonmusk @Tesla Federal Government of Nigeria needs support with 100-500 ventilators to assist with #Covid19 cases arising every day in Nigeria.” J.O Mustapha said: “I am ashamed that the Nigeria Ministry of Finance is begging for ventilators on Twitter. This is the same ministry that released $15.3M to buy cars for 469 lawmakers but cannot release just $2.7M to renovate hospitals for over 200 million Nigerians.” Rebecca Enonchong said “A whole Nigeria Ministry of Finance. Nigeria. Big Nigeria. Economic giant of Africa, begging @elonmusk for ventilators on Twitter.”
