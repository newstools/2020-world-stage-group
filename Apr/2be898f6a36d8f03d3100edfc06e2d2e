Russia’s recorded coronavirus caseload on Tuesday underwent another daily record rise, with more than 2,700 cases registered, as the total number throughout the country reached 21,100. At least 170 people have succumbed to the disease, a relatively low statistic for a large European country amid the pandemic, as most of Russia is under lockdown. Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that coronavirus outbreak in the country was not getting better, hence more efforts needed to curtail the deadly disease. Putin demanded that officials prepare for a worst-case scenario, adding that Russia’s military could become involved in further response measures. Earlier, a senior health official speculated that Russia’s caseload could rise to the peak by the end of April. Meanwhile, most of the cases had been in Russia’s capital and largest city, Moscow, which had responded by imposing strict quarantine measures, allowing residents to leave their homes only when absolutely necessary. Most of Russia’s regions have followed Moscow’s lead, imposing similar lockdown quarantine measures, in an effort to prevent a further spread of the disease. Earlier, putin said that there was no other choice for the public than to self-isolate.
