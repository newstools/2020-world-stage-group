The Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has ordered the immediate release of 26 inmates from the Correctional Custodial Centre in Ondo State, as measures to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state had recorded three positive cases of the virus, while the first case was confirmed negative on Monday, after testing negative twice. Mr Olusegun Ajiboye, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, in a statement in Akure, said the inmates had been duly convicted for various terms and had served portions of their sentences. According to him, the governor believes that decongesting the correctional custodial centre will also help prevent the spread of the Covid-19, not only amongst inmates, but also the officials.
