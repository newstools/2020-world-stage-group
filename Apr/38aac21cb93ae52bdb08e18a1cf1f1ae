China’s capital, Beijing, saw no new confirmed local or imported COVID-19 cases for 14 consecutive days that ended on Wednesday,  a local government official said. Xu Hejian, spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Government, told a news conference on Thursday  that Beijing reported no increase in confirmed, suspected or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases on Wednesday. “The city’s Chaoyang District, which was formerly categorised as a high-risk region due to reported clustered infections, has been downgraded to low-risk from Thursday,’’ Xu said. Beijing has lowered its emergency response to the COVID-19 epidemic from the top level to the second level.
