Sen. Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the APC on Saturday commiserated with the family of his Chief Security Officer, Lateef Raheem, who died in Lagos on April 24. In a condolence message to the family members of the deceased on Saturday, Tinubu described the late CSO as a good and decent man. He said that Raheem, who passed away in the early hours of April 24, was buried later that day in accordance with Muslim rites. Tinubu noted that the CSO died at the age of 51 years and that his unexpected death was due to complications from diabetes and high blood pressure. “Raheem was a person of strong and resilient character, who never sought special treatment or favours notwithstanding the  years of loyal and excellent service to me and a person who never took his work or valued position as my aide for granted. “I felt nothing but profound shock and deep loss when I was awakened early on Friday that my most trusted security aide had died. “I met Raheem in early 1999 when he was attached to me by the police during the campaign for the governorship election in Lagos and he stood faithfully beside me during the rigours of the primaries and campaign. “When he joined me, Lateef was a Corporal with school certificate, but  because of his thirst for knowledge and personal improvement, he subsequently acquired a university degree,” he said. Tinubu said that Raheem had risen to the level of Assistant Superintendent of Police before he died. “My deepest condolences are with his wives and children. With his passing, they have lost a caring husband and father.
