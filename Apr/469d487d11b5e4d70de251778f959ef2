WorldStage Newsonline– The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has confirmed a minor fire incident at its Jos branch today, Tuesday, April 21, 2020, saying it had been effectively put out and no damage was done to any records of the bank. According to a statement by Isaac Okorafor, Director, Corporate Communications, the fire alarm  was triggered at about 9.15 a.m and in line with the bank’s fire drill and protocol, the skeletal staff on essential duty were promptly evacuated from the building to the muster point. “Our Branch Controller quickly called the Fire Service at about 9.19 a.m. However, before the arrival of men of the fire service, the Bank’s security unit, relying on information from the Fire Alarm Dashboard, traced the fire to an air conditioner installed in the inverter room on the second floor of the building. They swiftly put out the fire with extinguishers and hydrants installed in the building,” the statement said. “The affected room has since been cordoned off for further investigation, while normal work has resumed at the branch.”
