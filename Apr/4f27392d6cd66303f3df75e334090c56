Spanish authorities have the coronavirus outbreak under control, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said citing the latest infection figures. The overall number of cases rose by 6,000 to reach 152,000 over the past 24 hours, the Health Ministry reported Thursday after several days of the new infection rate remaining stable. Since Wednesday, 683 people have died of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, taking the overall death toll to 15,238. That was slightly lower than the 757 registered the day before. Sanchez told parliament that a state of emergency that has been in place since March 15, helped quell the spread of the virus. The legislature is set to vote later on Thursday on whether to extend a nationwide lockdown until April 26, with approval of the measure a foregone conclusion.
