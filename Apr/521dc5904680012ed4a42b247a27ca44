The government Bayelsa State has announced plan  to seek the review of the revocation of its Oil Mining Licences (OML) for 46 oilfields by the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). Mr Daniel Alabra, Acting Chief Press Secretary to Gov. Duoye Diri, made this known in an interview  on Saturday. He said that the state government was already studying the revocation order with the intention of seeking a review. The OML 46 asset held by Bayelsa government located within onshore swamps in Bayelsa was won in 2013 through a bidding process conducted by the DPR. Meanwhile, the DPR on April 6, announced the revocation of 11 of the 13 marginal fields licenses it issued to indigenous oil firms to build capacity and promote Nigerians’ participation in the oil sector. Alabra further stated that the state was concerned about the revocation and would take steps to reverse it. The governor’s spokesman said that the DPR’s decision revoking the licences was most erroneous because the asset had been developed to the point of test production. “The governor is already being briefed on the matter, he is taking a holistic view in order to arrive at an informed decision. “The Bayelsa government holds 40 per cent equity in the oil block along with other investors who operate the field, the state does not run the oil business on a day to day basis,” he said. The chief press secretary expressed the Diri-led administration’s commitment to ensure the development of the oil fields. “We are hopeful that oil price will rebound, Bayelsa will retain its interests in Atala fields, this investment is well thought out and not misplaced.
