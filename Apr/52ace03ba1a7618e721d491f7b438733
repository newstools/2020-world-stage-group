WorldStage NewsOnline—- As part of efforts to protect citizens and reduce their risk of contracting COVID-19, the Lagos State Government says it has launched the ‘EKO TELEMED’ for residents. The state Ministry of Health, through its Twitter handle, said that the initiative was done through the Lagos State Health Management Agency (LASHMA). Dr Emmanuella Zamba, General Manager of LASHMA said that ‘EKO TELEMED’ was designed by LASHMA as part of its COVID-19 response. Zamba said that the project would increase access to care, reduce the challenge of going to hospitals during this period of restricted movements, except for emergencies. “It would also create an entry point for the quicker evacuation of confirmed and severely ill COVID-19 cases to the designated treatment facility. “This is aimed at ensuring better health outcomes for affected citizens, and reducing morbidity and mortality associated with the pandemic,” Zamba said. She said that through the project, residents would have access to highly-trained and experienced physicians for non-emergency primary care consultation through voice or video call from April 22. Zamba urged residents who develop any non-COVID-19 health issues during the lockdown period to call 08000EKOMED = 08000356633 toll-free line for consultation. She added that the toll-free line would enable residents converse with doctors in any of the four major languages in Lagos State which are English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo. The General Manager said that Doctors and Case Managers would be available 24/7 on ‘EKO TELEMED’ to provide medical services to residents for a period of eight weeks as the state continues to roll out its strategies for containing the COVID-19 pandemic. “If further medical treatment is needed after due consultation with the medical doctors, non-coronavirus cases would be referred to designated Healthcare Providers under the Lagos State Health Scheme (LSHS) or preferred Healthcare Providers,” Zamba said.
