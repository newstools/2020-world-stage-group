While we believe the risk-off sentiment could have caused the recent sell-off in the market, we opine that this may be one of the best periods to pick up some quality names with a medium to long term horizon. CURRENCY: At the IEFX window, while the Naira closed up by 0.09% against the GBP at N483.45, it closed down by 0.05% and 0.07% against the USD and EUR at N386.45 and N422.00 respectively. At the parallel market, while the Naira remained flat against the USD and GBP to close at N460 and N520 respectively, it lost 3.33% against the EUR to close at N465. Going forward, we expect the FX market to be dictated by heightened dollar demand and CBN FX policies. FIXED INCOME: Money market rates declined today as Open Buy Back and Overnight rates declined by 813bps and 868bps to close at 10.83% and 12.08% respectively. The bond market was mixed today as yields moved in different directions across most maturities. While the yield on the 5yr benchmark bond declined by 20bps to close at 8.43%, the yield on the 7yr benchmark bond rose by 4bps closing at 11.06%. However, the yield on the 10yr benchmark bond remained flat closing at 11.38%. In the near term, we expect market activity to be influenced by liquidity levels and foreign investor participation.
