The leadership of the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Saturday advised the Kwara Government to establish a molecular laboratory in the state. Dr Shuaib Belgore, NCDC Team Leader in Kwara, gave the advice at a meeting with the Technical Committee on COVID-19 and stakeholders at the state Ministry of Health in Ilorin. According to him, the molecular technique is used to diagnose and monitor disease, detect risk and decide which therapies will work best for individual patients. He said it could be over emphasised for the state to acquire a molecular laboratory as tests are useful in a range of medical specialism including infectious diseases. The NCDC team leader advised that if Kwara government could acquire a molecular laboratory, it would be a great legacy for the government in helping the people in the state and outside in area of identification and control of infectious diseases. Belgore noted that such laboratory would help in disease surveillance and sample collection, like collecting mucous at the back of the throat for COVID-19. “We use the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, which can find viral particles on a person and diagnosis of diseases such as Dengue fever, Yellow fever and Lassa fever, among others.” He explained that the test locates a particular Coronavirus gene sequence and creates multiple copies that could then be easily detected. Belgore, however, pointed out that there are protocols for transporting samples especially long distance transport and as such training of staff was key.
