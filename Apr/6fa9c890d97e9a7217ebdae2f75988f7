The World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Africa  says no fewer than 200 contacts of recent Ebola cases have been vaccinated in Beni,  Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). WHO had , on April 10, confirmed a new case of Ebola virus in the city of Beni after 52 days of not recording a case in the country. WHO disclosed this in its weekly bulletin on outbreaks and other Emergencies week 16, which covered April 13 to 19, released on the agency’s twitter account @WHOAFRO on Tuesday. The weekly bulletin focused  on public health emergencies occurring in the WHO African Region. The WHO Health Emergencies Programme is currently monitoring 108 events in the region. This week’s main articles covered key new and ongoing events, including: COVID-19 in the WHO African Region, Ebola virus disease  and measles in Democratic Republic of  the Congo. According to the bulletin, some public health measures have been taken to curb the spread of Ebola in the country. “Response and surveillance activities are being strengthened across all pillars, with preparedness enhanced in surrounding areas. “In Beni, three vaccination teams have been activated to carry out vaccinations around the  community  where the deaths were confirmed on 10 April, 2020 and 200 contacts were vaccinated,” it said. From 10 to 14 April 2020, it stated that three new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported, all from Beni Health Zone, North Kivu; two of the confirmed cases died after visiting several healthcare facilities. “The infection of the third individual has been epidemiologically linked to one of these cases, who is currently receiving care at an Ebola treatment centre (ETC). “Prior to this resurgence of  the cases, the last person confirmed to have EVD tested negative twice and was discharged from a treatment centre on  March 3, 2020. “Specimens from all confirmed cases were sent to the Institute Research Biomedicale (INRB) for genetic sequencing to support surveillance teams in investigating the source of infection and to determine if cases were linked to a known source of transmission. “A total of 332 contacts of these cases have been registered, of which 248 were followed up on April 14, 2020 and 200 of whom were vaccinated. “As of  April 19, 2019, a total of 3, 461 EVD cases, including 3, 316 confirmed and 147 probable cases had been reported and to date, confirmed cases had been reported from 29 health zones,’’ it added.
