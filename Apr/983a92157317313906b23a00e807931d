Local tailors in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, have commenced mass production of face masks with local fabrics to meet up with the huge demand for the item, occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Kayode Fayemi, had, in a statement issued by the Secretary to the State Government, Mr Biodun Oyebanji, directed residents to begin wearing face masks, as part of the measures to prevent the spread of the virus in the state. A  correspondent, who interacted with some of the tailors in Ado-Ekiti on Wednesday, reports that while some were producing the face masks in commercial quantity, others were only producing for family members, relatives and friends. Mrs Mercy Otiko of Remmy’s Stitches and Fashion, Ado-Ekiti, said that she was mass-producing the protective item.
“I discovered that the conventional face masks are scarce, and looking at the situation now, I have to be creative in meeting the demands of the people at this crucial time. ”I want to make and sell to interested people. As I’m doing this, I’m contributing my own quota to curbing the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and at the same time, making some economic gains.
“One face mask made with Ankara fabric goes for N100,” she said. Another tailor, Mrs Joyce James, said that Ankara face mask production was cheap and durable. “Though I do not produce the face masks for sale, I only sew them to assist my family members, friends and relatives at these trying times in our dear country and Ekiti State in particular. ” I source for my materials locally. All I need is Ankara fabric, elastic, thread and my sewing machine.
“The Ankara face masks are washable and durable,” she said.
