Danladi said the affected communities were – Aboro, Sabon Gida, Ungwan Bera, Janda, Ungwan Goma and Kurmin Goro. “We are approaching rainy season and some of these people now have their houses destroyed. “All their property are out in the open and I really feel for them, especially when you consider the hard times we are in. “One primary school had its roof completely taken off, and for some others it was buildings housing goods that they sell that were destroyed by the rainstorm,” he said.

According to him, the council is in the process of assessing the full extent of the damage with a view to working out relief packages to those affected.
