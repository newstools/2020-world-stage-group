The government  Ondo State on Saturday announced another positive case of COVID-19 pandemic in the state. Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu made this known through his verified twitter handle, identifying the case as a police officer. The twitter handle reads: “Earlier today, I got news of another positive case of #COVID-19 admitted to our facility in Akure. The case of this individual, who is a police officer, is unique. “He was tested in Lagos, but came to Ondo state while awaiting his results. Upon receiving a positive result, he claimed to have returned back to Lagos. “According to him, he waited a few days in Lagos to be picked up. When this failed, he panicked and rushed back to Akure for treatment. “While we appreciate the confidence reposed in our facilities, We do find it most reckless on the part of the officer of the law to risk the lives of others. “I am most disappointed in the level of porosity of the entry points to the state. The police officer should know better.
