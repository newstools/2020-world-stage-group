According to him, working with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Lagos State Ministry of Health (LSMOH), testing capacity for COVID19 has increased. Sanwo-Olu said that the state government would continue to do all it could to stop the spread of the virus. “As a state, we understand that this lockdown will stretch us because of some structural problems we are contending with. “However, I want to thank Lagosians for rising up with empathy and strength.
