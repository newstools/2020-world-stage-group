Reacting to the announcement, Biden described Sanders as a good leader, and “one of the most powerful voices for change in our country”. “I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. “And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to,” the former Veepee on his tweeter handle. Trump also immediately tweeted his reaction to the development, thanking one of Sanders’ contenders for the Democratic Party’s ticket, Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “Bernie Sanders is OUT!

If not for her, Bernie would have won almost every state on Super Tuesday! “This ended just like the Democrats and the DNC wanted, same as the Crooked Hillary fiasco. “The Bernie people should come to the Republican Party, TRADE!” The president tweeted.
