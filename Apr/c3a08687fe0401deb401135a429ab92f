Nigeria’s major opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described the death of Malam Abba Kyari, the Chief of Staff to the President Muhammadu Buhari as depressing and saddening. The party condolence message was issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, on Saturday in Abuja. “The PDP comforts President Muhammadu Buhari, the Kyari family, the government and people of Borno and the nation at large for the painful loss and prayed that the Almighty Allah grants the deceased eternal rest. “Similarly, the PDP commiserates with families of all the victims of COVID-19 pandemic and pray for the speedy recovery of the sick who are receiving treatment in various isolation centres,” he said.
