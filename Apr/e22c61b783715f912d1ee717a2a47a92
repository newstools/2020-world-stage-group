The management of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has urged the general public to disregard messages and video being circulated in the social media of alleged recruitment exercise by its acting Director-General, Ms Mary Uduk. Mrs Efe Ebelo, the commission’s Head, Corporate Communications, said this in a statement on Monday. Ebelo said the messages and video being circulated were  false and called on the general public to disregard them. “The commission’s  attention has been drawn to some messages and a video being circulated in the social media; wherein the commission is alleged to have carried out a recruitment exercise where 811 persons were employed, all from Anambra  with one from Kano State. “The messages parade the person shown in the video as Ms Mary Uduk, the acting-director general of the commission. “The commission wishes to inform the general public that the person shown in the video is not the Acting director-general of SEC, and no such recruitment exercise was conducted. “For the avoidance of any doubt, since the acting director – general assumed office, the commission has not carried out any recruitment exercise.
