WorldStage NewsOnline— Following the extension of the lockdown in Lagos, FCT, Ogun and other states, President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to provide palliative for Nigerians by transferring money into their various accounts, using the Bank Verification Number (BVN). AURA Cool in a tweet said: “Dear Federal Govt, Nigerians enter another crucial 2wks of survival, battling against all odds to combat #COVIDー19 & rising threats on the streets.
They need crucial intervention.
They need palliatives.
They need cash however small
Yes you can #payusviaBVN
Thank u for listening.” Dr. Penking said “You think Buhari’s government does not know that paying via bvn is the easiest and most transparent way they can pay us? They know. Their only problem is that with this method, adequate accounts can be kept about their expenses and they won’t be able to steal much.” Another Nigerian, Series Abiodun said: “BVN is basically to address identity theft. According to NISS, 38.5 million accounts has BVN identity as at 2019 which means there’s a database… If Namibia is said to pay their citizens ‘reliefs’ for COVID19 through their bank accounts, why can’t the Nigerian govt #PayusviaBVN?” The president in a nationwide broadcast on Monday extended the lockdown in Lagos, FCT and Ogun for another 14 days and promised to expand social register from 2.6 million households to 3.6 million households in the next two weeks for immediate cash transfer, a process that has failed to yield any positive result. Buhari said, “This means we will support an additional one million homes with our social investment programs. A technical committee is working on this and will submit a report to me by the end of this week. “In the coming weeks, I want to assure you that the Federal Government, through the Presidential Task Force, will do whatever it takes to support you in this very difficult period. I have no doubt that, by working together and carefully following the rules, we shall get over this pandemic.”
