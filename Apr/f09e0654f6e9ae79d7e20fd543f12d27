Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with the Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, on his 68th birthday, wishing him more wisdom and strength as he continues to pilot affairs of the ruling party. The President’s congratulatory message was conveyed in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Friday. President Buhari joined family, friends, APC members, and supporters across the country, and abroad, in saluting the party chairman for his courage, diligence, and resilience in consistently rallying everyone around the onerous task of taking Nigeria to next level. He affirmed that Oshiomhole’s skill in mobilising people and resources had truly galvanised the party, with leaders at various levels regularly setting and realising targets. According to him, such targets will leave lasting legacies, especially in providing security, ensuring an inclusive economy that works for all, and promoting transparency and accountability. The President urged Oshiomhole to be more steadfast and focused on carrying all members and supporters along in realising the larger goal of making life better for all Nigerians. He also appreciated Oshiomhole’s sacrifices for the country over the years as a labour leader and as a governor.
