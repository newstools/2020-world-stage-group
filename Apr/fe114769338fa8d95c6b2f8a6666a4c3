About 115 inmates regained their freedom from six Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS) centres in Nasarawa State, following President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive to decongest prisons to contain the spread of COVID-19. Gov. Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa state, while performing a brief ceremony on Wednesday in Lafia, advised the freed inmates to be agent of positive change to the society. Sule, represented by the Commissioner for Justice and Attorney General of Nasarawa state, Dr Abdulkarim Kana, charged the freed inmates to be law abiding in order not to find themselves back in the correctional centre. “As you can see, you are released unconditionally, whatever crime you have committed have been pardoned, you can live a successful life without committing crime, find anything you can do to earn a living,” he advised. He enjoined the inmates to comply with government’s directive on COVID-19 such as observance of physical distancing,  coughing into elbows, staying at home, washing of hand with soap and water also use of alcohol based sanitisers. Sule disclosed that the Federal Government under the leadership of  President Muhammadu Buhari had facilitated their released by paying for damages and compensation of some inmates, while Nasarawa State government paid various fines to secure their released. Nasarawa state government had given the sum of N5,000 to each of the freed inmates as transportation fare to ease their movement to their destinations. Earlier Emmanuel Okoro, Controller of NCS, Nasarwa State Command, advised the freed inmates to be law abiding and shun any act capable of bringing them back to the correctional facilities. Okoro described their freedom as a compliance with the presidential directive, which aimed at decongesting the correctional facilities against COVID- 19 in the country.
