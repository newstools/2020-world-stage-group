The Rockefeller Foundation, in partnership with SecondMuse and OpenIDEO, today announced the Top 10 Finalists for the Food System Vision Prize. These Finalists were selected from a pool of more than 1,300 applicants from 110 countries, all seeking to develop a Vision of the regenerative and nourishing food system that they aspire to create by the year 2050. The Top 10 Finalists, whose visions focus on Canada, China, India, Kenya, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Peru, and the U.S., were chosen among 76 Semi-Finalists. They were selected based on their potential to inspire real, positive and bold transformation of a specific food system that is actionable, concrete and believed to be attainable by 2050. These Visions aim to tackle challenges tied to six themes: environment, diets, economics, culture, technology, and policy. The Food System Vision Prize was launched nearly a year ago as an invitation for organizations, institutions, companies, universities and governments across the globe to develop actionable solutions for the food systems of tomorrow. An esteemed panel of Judges, including food system leaders from across academia, civil society and the private sector, reviewed the Semi-Finalist submissions and selected the 10 Finalists. “The inspiring Visions they have put forward paint a picture of a more hopeful future food system – one that is equitable, sustainable and can transform our planet and improve the diets and health of people across the globe,” said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. The Top 10 Finalists for the Food System Vision Prize are:         “These Visions are a great example of the importance of—and opportunity for—innovation during a crisis. This is even more urgent given the severe stresses placed on food systems as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Roy Steiner, Senior Vice President of the Food Initiative at The Rockefeller Foundation. “We look forward to seeing how they move their ideas from Vision to action.” In September, the Finalists will advance to a three-month virtual Accelerator phase during which they will receive support to further refine their Visions and find pathways for implementation and impact. The Accelerator will focus on stakeholder engagement, storytelling, communications, and action planning through virtual programming, one-on-one mentorship and customized support. Each Finalist is eligible to become a Top Visionary and to receive a prize of  $200,000 USD. Top Visionaries will be announced in December 2020. “Visions teams took a systems approach to include diverse voices while incorporating social and environmental priorities. These Finalists give us reason for optimism, offering exciting and tangible possibilities to transform food systems, from production to consumption, to ensure a healthy and sustainable future for people and our planet,” said Maria Balcazar Tellez, Program Manager and Food System Vision Prize Lead at SecondMuse. “Systems change means going beyond a few organizations working in silos. This Prize supports Visions rooted in local communities, while building a global network for teams to connect, learn and gain inspiration from each other,” says Matt Ridenour, Food Portfolio Lead at OpenIDEO.
