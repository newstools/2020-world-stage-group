The corporation in its June Monthly Financial and Operations Report (MFOR) released on Sunday in Abuja said that the amount signalled a marked improvement in revenue earnings, following the ease of the COVID-19 pandemic global lockdown and the subsequent increased demand and firmer prices for the black gold in the international market. The report indicated that petroleum receipts for the month reflected crude oil earnings of $230.65million, with gas and miscellaneous proceeds standing at $75.97million and $71.80million dollars, respectively.

On petroleum products supply in the downstream sector, the report said that 1.34 billion litres of white products were distributed and sold across the country by NNPC’s Downstream subsidiary, the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC). It noted that the figure was significantly higher than the 950.67million litres of white products sold and distributed in May 2020. “Again, an apparent reflection of the gradual ease of the lockdown in the country and the picking up of business activities,” it said.
