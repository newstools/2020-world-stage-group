WorldStage Newsonlinbe– The Minister of Aviation, Mr Hadi Sirika has said that the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu is ready for resumption of flights. Sirika said this on Saturday in Enugu after the final round of inspection of rehabilitation works in the airport prior to the official reopening of the complex. The Federal Government had in August 2019 shut down Akanu Ibiam International Airport over security reasons which include its bad runway and landing aids, the presence of market close to the airport attracting birds, leading to constant bird strikes,  wrong placement of the state radio station mast directly facing the runways. However, the minister, who landed at the airport on Saturday evening with a private jet, No.5N-PAZ said that he was delighted to have been in the flight that landed in the airport. He said he had arrived ahead of the Aug. 30, official reopening of the airport to inspect the readiness of the facility for flight resumption. “We are ready for the official reopening of this airport tomorrow and I am happy that we have been able to achieve this as scheduled,” Sirika said.
