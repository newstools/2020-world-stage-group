U.S. President Donald Trump needs “to stop listening to novice bullies,” tweeted Iran’s foreign minister on Wednesday as he praised a UN decision not accede to a US request to trigger snapback sanctions on Iran. “(US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo)’s lawless bullying leaves U.S. isolated again,” tweeted Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. On Tuesday, the UN Security Council president said that body would not take further action on the U.S. bid to trigger a return of UN sanctions against Iran. “There is no consensus in the council and thus the president is not in the position to take further action,” said Indonesia’s UN ambassador, Dian Triansyah Djani, whose country is presiding over the Security Council in August. U.S. Ambassador to the UN Kelly Craft immediately released a statement condemning the Security Council’s position. “For months and months, we told the Council that President Trump would never allow the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism to freely buy and sell planes, tanks, missiles, and other kinds of conventional weapons,” it read. The U.S. formally notified the UN of its demand to reimpose sanctions on Iran on Thursday. The move was immediately rejected by Britain, France, and Germany, the three U.S. allies who are party to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.
