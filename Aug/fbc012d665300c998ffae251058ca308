The president, who recalled his meeting with Williams in January during a town hall meeting with Nigerian professionals in the United Kingdom, said: “He was passionate about our country, deeply committed to a Nigeria that attains her position in the comity of nations. ”It’s sad to lose such a hopeful, ebullient soul so soon.” Williams was a leader and pioneer of  the Nigerian Think Tank Group (NTTG) and staunch member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Buhari Campaign Organisation in the UK. The deceased, a successful real estate professional and community leader, was also a member of the Institute of Directors, London and Kent.
