WorldStage Newsonline, Omatek Ventures Plc, a public quoted firm which assembles and sells computer equipment and accessories in Nigeria and offers an after-sales support service has approved the outstanding audited financial statements from 2015 to 2019 and authorised its Board of Directors to source for investors and or any other means of raising funds for the business of the company. These were parts of the resolutions at the company’s 11th Annual General Meeting  held on the 15th December, 2020, at the Golden Gate Restaurant, 25B Glover Road, Ikoyi, Lagos and via ZOOM. In a notification at the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the company said that the “resolutions are with immediate effect.” The death of the founder of Omatek, Florence Seriki on 3rd March 2017 may have considerably affected the fortune of the company. Until her death, Seriki served as Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director of Omatek Ventures Plc, which she started about 25 years before her death. WorldStage earlier reported the resignation of Senator Chief Kola Bajomo as a director in Omatek subsidiaries and related companies.
