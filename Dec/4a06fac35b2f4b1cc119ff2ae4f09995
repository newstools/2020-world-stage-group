WorldStage Newsonline– Mobile phone operators are set to join in the registration National Identification Numbers (NINs). Following the directive that all mobile phone subscribers should provide valid NINs, the mobile phone operators in the country had been issued NIN registration licence which will result in the integration of their registration system with the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) and facilitate NIN enrolment in the country. MTN, the leading mobile operator in the country confirmed that it had received the licence along with other operators and over 8 million subscribers had uploaded their NINs as at December 24, 2020. Government had given three weeks extension for subscribers with NIN from December 30, 2020 to January 19, 2021; and subscribers without NIN got six weeks extension to February 9, 2021. MTN said the directive “means that while recharge activity and other services continue to be available, operators cannot add new subscribers. The Federal Government had earlier directed that mobile operators should ensure the linkage of phone numbers with NINs with the threat that violations will be met with stiff sanctions, including the possibility of the withdrawal of operating licences. The primary aim of the exercise was said to create one centralized, reliable identification database.
