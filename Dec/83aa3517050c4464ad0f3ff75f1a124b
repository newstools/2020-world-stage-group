*To use polio storage facilities for COVID-19 vaccines WorldStage Newsonline– Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, has said that the Federal Government was substantially ready for a successful COVID-19 vaccination to save lives of citizens. He told the Senate leadership about the Federal Government plans to procure COVID-19 vaccines worth N400 billion for citizens, saying  that the country which had successfully fought polio, would use the same storage facilities (cold chains) to store the COVID-19 vaccines. He urged the Senate to have confidence in the plan for COVID-19 vaccine campaign. He said that about N400 billion would be required to vaccinate 70 per cent of Nigeria’s 211 million population, at eight dollars per person. According to him, N156 billion will be needed in 2021 while N200 billion in 2022. In his remarks, President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan expressed doubt over the ability of the Federal Ministry of Health to effectively store and distribute the COVID-19 vaccines when they arrive in the country. Lawan said the National Assembly was ready to support the funding of adequate vaccines to save Nigerians. He noted that officials of the Ministry of Health must convince the parliament that they had adequate facilities and manpower to protect the preventive substance. “I have not been convinced with your presentation that we are ready to bring in the vaccines. “You have to do much more to convince me that we are ready,” he added.
