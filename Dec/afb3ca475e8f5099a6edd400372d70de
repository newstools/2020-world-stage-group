A unit of the Moroccan Navy, on patrol off Laayoune, on Thursday assisted an inflatable boat in difficulty with 43 sub-Saharan illegal migrants on board. Also on board were two dead persons, military sources said. The rescued migrants, all in a very poor health, were brought back to the port of Laayoune, after receiving the necessary care on board the Royal Navy boat. They were handed over to the Moroccan Gendarmerie for the usual procedures and the two dead bodies were deposited at the cityâ€™s morgue.
