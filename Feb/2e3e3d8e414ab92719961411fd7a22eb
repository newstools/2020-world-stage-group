WorldStage Newsonline– Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has assured subscribers of the defunct Dantata Success and Profitable Company (DSPC) of progress being made to get all the parties involved settle their claims . According to statement by the Head of corporate communications, SEC, Efe Ebelo, verification had been completed and the Commission was discussing with the Administrators/Trustees and the Management of the DSPC with a view to settling the claims of subscribers. “The Commission urges members of the public who subscribed to the schemes to be calm as all efforts are being made to resolve the matter,” the statement said. “The Commission remains committed to its core mandate of protecting investors and assures the general public that it shall perform this function in line with extant securities legislation.” The SEC earlier sealed off the premises of DSPC for engaging in illegal capital market activities.

It was said to have  sold registration forms to prospective investors according to their investment plans, ranging from N1,000 to N3,000, with the minimum amount investable being N50,000 and a maximum amount of N5m. Unsuspecting investors were promised of returns of monthly interest on the investment of between 25 and 50%, depending on the nature and type of the investment. The investment period of the scheme was pegged at a minimum of 30 working days and a maximum of 12 months with an offer of interest rates on a short and medium-term basis.
