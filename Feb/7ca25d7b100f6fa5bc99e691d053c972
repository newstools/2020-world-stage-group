Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday ordered the Nigerian Government to pay N200,000 each to both Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare for attempting to slow down proceedings and further delay the commencement of the trial proper by making several false statements. Sowore and a co-accused, Olawale Bakare, are standing trial on a seven-count charge of treasonable felony, fraud, cyberstalking and insulting President Muhammadu Buhari. Sowore and Bakare were arrested on August 3 by the State Security Services (SSS) for planning a protest popularised with the hashtag #RevolutionNow. The SSS had on December 6 rearrested Mr Sowore at the premises of the Federal High Court in Abuja a day after he was released from their custody. The publisher and Mr Bakare were released the night before on the order of Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu after spending 124 days in SSS custody. However, Nobel Laureate Professor Wole Soyinka andÂ former Nigerian lawmaker Shehu Sani who represented Kaduna Central until 2019 were present to show support for Sowore at his trial on Wednesday, Feb 12, 2020.
