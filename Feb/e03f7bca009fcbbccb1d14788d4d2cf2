Twitter said on Saturday that an official Twitter account of the Olympics and the media Twitter account of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) had been hacked and temporarily locked. The accounts were hacked through a third-party platform, a spokesperson for the social media platform said in an emailed statement, without giving further details. “As soon as we were made aware of the issue, we locked the compromised accounts and are working closely with our partners to restore them,” the Twitter spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the IOC separately said that the IOC was investigating the potential breach. Last month, the official Twitter accounts of several U.S. National Football League (NFL) teams, including the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs, were affected. They were hacked a few days ahead of the Super Bowl. Earlier this month, some of Facebook’s official Twitter accounts were briefly compromised.
