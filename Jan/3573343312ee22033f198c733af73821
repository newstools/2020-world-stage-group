The NDE Coordinator in the state, Alhaji Abubakar Muhammad disclosed this in an interview in Dutse on Wednesday. Muhammad said that the beneficiaries would be selected from Babura, Guri, Kazaure, Maigatari and Miga LGAs.

Muhmmad said  that the beneficiaries would be expected to be between 18 years  and 30 years of age and must not be benefiting from any interventions either from  the federal or  the state governments.
