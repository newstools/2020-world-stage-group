The Accountant-General of the Federation, Ahmed Idris says the Federal Government has begun the implementation of 7.5 per cent Value Added Tax on government transactions. Idris confirmed the development during a chat with journalists on Wednesday in Abuja. The move followed the signing of the Finance Bill into law, on Monday, by the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd), after it was passed by the National Assembly on November 21, 2019. The objectives of the Act are to strategically promote fiscal equity by mitigating instances of regressive taxation; reform domestic tax laws to align with global best practices, and introduce tax incentives for investments in infrastructure and capital markets. It is also aimed at supporting small businesses in line with the ongoing ease of doing business reforms; and raise revenues for the government by various fiscal measures, including an increase in the rate of Value Added Tax from five per cent to 7.5 per cent.
