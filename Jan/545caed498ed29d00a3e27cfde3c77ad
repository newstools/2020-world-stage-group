The Niger State Governor,  Abubakar Bello has condemned the renewed armed banditry attacks on kudodo Nakpala, and Gulapai communities of Shiroro Local Government Area of the state. Bello in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mrs Mary Berje,  in Minna on Saturday described the incidence as unfortunate. The governor said that air and land surveillance by security personnel had been deployed to the area to fish and flush out criminals terrorising the communities. Bello noted with concern that the criminals were taking advantage of the vast and difficult terrain of the forestland to unleash terror on innocent people. According to him, the government is fully supporting the joint security taskforce to tackle the menace. He commiserated with the victims of the attacks and directed that stringent military action be taken to bring to an end the persistent attacks in communities in the area. The governor attributed the major causes of attacks to the increasing infiltration of armed bandits into Shiroro axis from neighbouring states to create mayhem by dislodging innocent inhabitants from their ancestral fatherlands. He, however, called for calm in the affected communities and Shiroro Local Government Area in particular, and appealed to members of the communities to cooperate with security agencies by providing credible intelligence reports that will uncover the hideouts of the bandits.
