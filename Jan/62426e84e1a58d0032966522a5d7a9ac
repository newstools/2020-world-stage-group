The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has commended the military for keeping the country safe and preserving it for future generation. In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Malam Lanre Issa-Onilu, in Abuja on Wednesday, the ruling party lauded the military on the 2020 Armed Forces Remembrance Day. “Our troops are engaged on the front lines of the war against Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP), Boko Haram terrorists, murderous armed herdsmen, kidnappers and other criminal elements. “We all have a conscious and collective duty to ensure that the sacrifice and labour of our troops – retired, serving and those who have paid the supreme price in defence of our country – will never be in vain,” he said. According to him, the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has shown great determination and commitment to improve the lives of our military personnel. “This is done through improved military budget, better welfare for armed forces personnel and the families left behind by fallen soldiers and procurement of modern military equipment for our troops.
