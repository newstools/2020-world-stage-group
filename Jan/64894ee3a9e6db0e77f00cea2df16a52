WorldStage Newsonline– The Federal Government of Nigeria plans to borrow the sum of N850 billion and N744.99 billion for both external and domestic borrowings in 2020, according the  Director General of the Debt Management Office (DMO) Patience Onihu . Speaking at a press briefing on public debt stock in Abuja on Friday she said the Federal Government also planned to float about N150b FGN bonds, sukuk and possibly green bonds to fund capital projects. She noted that borrowing plan was a collective decision between the Legislature and Executive,  saying  the strategic borrowing plan was in compliance with the law. She however disclosed that the total debt stock as a percentage of GDP was 18.47 per cent at 30th September 2019, while noting that the percentage fares better when compared with the debt to GDP ratios of other countries. She said a presentation by the DMO in an interactive session showed  that the total public debt, comprising that of FGN, 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory as at September 2019 stood at N26.215 trillion, adding that comparative figure for June 2019 was N25.701 trillion, which implied that in the quarter July to September 2019, the total debt grew by 2.0%. She further noted that the Total Public Debt as at September 2019 included Promissory Notes in the amount of N812.650 billion which had been issued to settle the FGN’s arrears to Oil Marketing Companies and State Governments under the Promissory Programme approved by the Federal Executive Council and the National Assembly. “The Ratio of Domestic Debt to External Debt at 69:31 as at September 2019 was an improvement over the Ratio  of 71:29  as at September 2018 compared to the target of 60:40 in the Medium-Term Debt Management Strategy,” she said. “The Ratio of Long Term to Short Term Debt in the Domestic Debt as at September 2019 was 80:20, which shows that the target of 75:25 had been outperformed by September 2019.Furthermore, it was an improvement over the Ratio of 73:23 recorded in September 2018.” Onihu explained that the low revenue base of Nigeria relative to its GDP was clearly reflected in the high Debt Service to Revenue Ratio. “This clearly brings to fore the need for revenues to grow,” she said. “The efforts towards increasing and diversifying revenue such as the passage of the Finance Act and Strategic Revenue Growth Initiative of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Budget and National Planning should thus be supported.”
