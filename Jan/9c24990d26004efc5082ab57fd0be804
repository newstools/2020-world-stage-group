The management of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has promised that it will collaborate with the Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) to promote the acceptability of insurance by its members. The LCCI’ s President, Mrs Olubunmi Toki, made the promise during a courtesy visit to the chamber by a delegation from the NCRIB. A statement from NCRIB and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Lagos stated that the team was led by its President, Dr Bola Onigbogi. Toki noted that insurance which plays catalytic roles in national economies of most nations is at the butt of Nigeria’s financial services sector. She said that this was partly due to poor advocacy and strategies that could have helped to grow the sector. She promised that the LCCI would, henceforth, promote the insurance products among its members. Dr Bola Onigbogi in her response applauded the LCCI which she said had continued to be the vocal voice for the nation’s economic development. She said that insurance brokers, as the professional intermediaries in the insurance value chain, would always be engaged by the Chamber to strengthen the businesses of its member companies. “This is, especially, in the area of risk management and insurance,” she said. Onigbogi explained that under her leadership, NCRIB had increased its advocacy, particularly, in the review of the laws on public procurement and health insurance. She said that this was undergoing review at the National Assembly.
