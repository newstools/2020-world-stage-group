He said that the government had developed a Methanol Development Technology Policy and introduced a sensitisation program that would be used to educate the public about the policy. “Almost all the things that we use are imported from other countries. This is something that should not continu “We need a change. We must be self-reliant. We must produce many of the things that we need as a nation, by doing that Nigeria will become great. “We are here to sensitise the people of the Southeast on this policy that has been passed by the Federal Executive Council and its relevance to the nation’s economy,” Onu added.
