Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash today. The Los Angeles Laker legend was 41. According to this report by SB Nation, Bryant and at least three other individuals were reportedly in Bryant’s private helicopter when it went down in Calabasas, a suburb of Los Angeles located in the hills west of the San Fernando Valley. Bryant reportedly has been long known for traveling frequently by helicopter to get around Southern California and avoid the traffic. Bryant, the son of former NBA player Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, spent his entire 20 year career with the Los Angeles Lakers, being drafted as a 17 year old out of high school in 1996. He was a five time NBA Champion, a former NBA MVP, and an 18 time All Star who had 11 All-NBA first team appearances, along with 2 apiece on the All-NBA second team and All-NBA Third Team.
