The government of  Akwa Ibom State has donated relief materials to the victims of a fire outbreak that occurred at Iwuokpom Community in Ibeno Local Government Area. The Deputy Governor, Mr Moses Ekpo, who made the donation on behalf of the state government, on Saturday also sympathized with the victims who lost valuable property to the inferno. The  relief materials donated by the state government include: 127 bags of rice, and 38 bags of beans. Also donated are: 127 bags of flour, 127 bags of `garri’, 127 bags of maize, and 379 pieces mosquito nets. Other relief materials include: mattresses, wrappers, brocades, bundles of zinc, 379 bags of cement, and 183 ceiling boards. Ekpo said that the relief materials were the first batch to be donated to the affected victims by the state government. “For those who lost their houses in the inferno that happened on Jan. 3, the government is looking into it, to be able to give them relief materials,” Ekpo said. He reassured the victims that the state government was making plans to rehabilitate them. “The state will continue to do its best to provide rehabilitation to the fire victims at Iwuokpom Community in  Ibeno Local Government Area,” he said. The deputy governor, however, said that it was a sad development that the inferno destroyed property worth millions of naira. He also urged ExxonMobil to visit the victims and assist them with relief materials.
