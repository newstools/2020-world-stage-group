This was disclosed in Enugu on Saturday, by Mr Christopher Ogbu, the coordinator of the Small Towns Water and Sanitation Unit of Enugu State Ministry of Water Resources. Ogbu said that the project was still at the early stage and would soon begin in the state as other logistics were being put in place. The coordinator said that WaterAid had been partnering the state for some years through Small Towns Water and Sanitation Unit (STU) of Enugu State Ministry of Water Resources. ” WaterAid Nigeria has been partnering Enugu state for some years now and STU has been the eye of the state in the partnership,” he said.
