The leadership of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) is starting calibration of the Doppler VHF Omni-Directional Range (DVOR) and the Category III (CAT III) Instrument Landing System (ILS) on Friday in Lagos Airport. Mr Khalid Emele, the General Manager, Public Affairs, NAMA, confirmed the development in Lagos. Calibration aircraft acquired by the Federal Government for calibration of navigational aids was not operational because of numerous factors. This made some aircraft to land at the neighbouring countries last week due to inability to have a clearer visibility at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) in Lagos. Emele said the  agency had commenced the calibration technically in Abuja with some of the flight instructors and engineers in Abuja for the pre-calibration exercise. The NAMA official said: “Jan. 16 was for the pre-calibration brief, while today, Jan. 17, the aircraft will be operated and we will commence the calibration exercise. “We are hopeful to commence with Lagos DVOR and CATIII.’’ He said that the airspace managers would be calibrating the navigational aids of all the nation’s airports. Emele said that this include the ongoing installation of Enugu new ILS/DME that would be ready soon with the newly- acquired King Air 350i calibration airplane with Omni Blue as a backup in case of failure. He said the ILS calibration was done twice a year in February and November and every six months because of the level of accuracy required. Emele explained that while the Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-Directional Range (VOR) was calibrated once in a year, the radar system was once in every three years. Calibration is a process that ensures the safety of air navigation, principally by conducting regular flight inspection. Other processes are the calibration of test equipment and avionics systems, surveillance of airspace systems, and certification of navigation aids and associated facilities.
