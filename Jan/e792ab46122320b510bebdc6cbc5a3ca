Gov. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq of Kwara State has demolished the Senator Bukola Sarakis’ political home in Ilorin. The building was demolished early Thursday morning after security operatives dispersed protesters, including aged women within the complex. The state government had fix midnight for the demolition exercise to avoid a clash with Saraki’s loyalists who had been keeping a vigil in the area. AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, the state governor, in December, 2019 announced his decision to revoke the late Olusola Saraki’s property owing to alleged illegality in its acquisition. He said the land was originally designated for the construction of a secretariat and parking lot of the civil service clinic, but that it was unlawfully allocated to a private firm — Asa Investments Limited — without any record of payment to the state government. But Bukola Saraki, former senate president, countered this statement, saying his late father lawfully acquired the land from the state government.
