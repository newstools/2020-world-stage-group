A floating nuclear power plant operated by Russia’s state-owned nuclear agency, ROSATOM, has started providing heating to homes in the Russian Arctic port town of Pevek, in the country’s Chukotka region. Vitaly Trutnev, Head of the agency’s Directorate for Construction and Operation of the floating nuclear thermal power plant, made this known in a statement on Wednesday in Lagos. “So far, the floating nuclear power plant has only produced electricity. “From now on, it produces two products in addition to electricity; it also produces heat. “The floating nuclear power plant was originally designed to gradually replace Chukotka’s oldest coal-powered Chaun Thermal Power Plant, which was put into operation back in 1944,” Trutnev said. He said the plant with an electric capacity of 70 megawatts, was fully inaugurated on May 22, and officially became the 11th nuclear power plant in Russia. “Till date, it has generated over 57 million kilowatt hour of electricity since its connection to the grid. “In the future, the plant is projected to fully meet Chukotka’s growing demand for electricity,” he said.
