A set of controversial constitutional amendments that will enable Russian President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036 entered into force on Saturday, with the full text published by the government. The news comes a day after Putin signed a decree to enact the amendments. Putin received landslide approval for the package in a nationwide referendum earlier this week, with more than three-quarters of the votes in favour, according to the official tally. The referendum was not independently observed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which has traditionally monitored Russian elections. The European Union demanded that Russia investigate allegations of irregularities in the voting, including voter coercion and multiple voting. The amendments enable Putin to run for re-election twice more and bolster the power of the government’s legislative branch, dominated by the United Russia party, which is loyal to Putin. They also instate a constitutional ban on gay marriage and make it so that Putin’s fiercest challenger, Alexei Navalny, cannot attempt to run for the nation’s top political office for the next 15 years, as every presidential candidate now must have lived in Russia for the past quarter-century.
