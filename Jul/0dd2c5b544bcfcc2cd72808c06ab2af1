The NLC leadership had, on September 19, 2019, written to the Ministry of Labour and Employment seeking the remittance of accrued rights and benefits of Federal civil servants to the retirees’ RSAs. “We wish to commend the Federal Government for its recent decision to release the total sum of N7.45 billion Accrued Rights and Benefits into the RSA of Federal retirees covering April and May 2019. “This responsive and responsible move by the Federal Government has come at a very critical time considering the adversity imposed on our retirees and pensioners by the novel Coronavirus pandemic,” he said. He called on government to also consider the plight of retirees from June 2019 to July 2020, and expressed optimism that the request would be kindly considered.
