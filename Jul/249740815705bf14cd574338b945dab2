Iran on Saturday vowed retaliatory measures if Europe were to give in to the U.S. pressures for extending a UN arms embargo on Iran, Tasnim news agency reported. “We have warned the European countries that if they give in to the political and diplomatic pressures from the United States, Iran has effective measures in response,’’ Abbas Mousavi, spokesman of the foreign ministry, told Tasnim. According to Mousavi, Washington wants to portray Tehran as a threat to security in the region when the U.S. forces are the real threat to regional peace, stability and security. The U.S. has recently pressed the UN Security Council for the extension of the UN arms embargo on Iran that will expire in October.
