WorldStage Newsonline– The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) said it has taken delivery of another reactivated Aircraft, an ATR-42 (NAF 930), a boost to it Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) platform. NAF Director of public relations and information, Air Commandor Ibikunle Daramola in a statement on Friday in Abuja said the aircraft was received at the flight line of 307 Executive Airlift Group, Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja by the Chief of Policy and Plans, Air Vice Marshal Oladayo Amao, on behalf of the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, who is currently in the Northeast to oversee the ongoing subsidiary Operation LONG REACH II. He said, “The reactivation of the aircraft, which was successfully executed at the Rheinland Air Services (RAS) Facilities, Monchengladbach, Germany after clocking 5,000 hours of operation, was earlier scheduled to be completed within 6 months. “However, due to the effect of the COVID-19 Pandemic, the completion date was extended by 3 months. “It would be recalled that, over the last 5 years, the NAF, in collaboration with its technical partners, has successfully reactivated some of its platforms in-country, including the conduct of Periodic Depot Maintenance (PDM) on 2 C-130H aircraft as well as the PDM/Avionics upgrade of 3 Alpha Jets. “However, being the first PDM on the ATR-42 aircraft (NAF 930) after 10 years of operation, it was considered expedient to conduct this major maintenance activity abroad to take advantage of the facilities and expertise of RAS as well as build the capacity of the NAF Engineers and Technicians that participated in the reactivation process in Germany. “ Other dignitaries present to receive the newly reactivated aircraft were the Director of Operations, AVM Ayoola Jolasinmi, Director of Air Engineering, AVM Isah Muhammad, and the Commander 307 EAG, Air Commodore Francis Edosa.” The statement added that the the “delivery of the newly reactivated ATR-42 (NAF 930) is in furtherance of its sustained efforts at ensuring availability of more serviceable ISR platforms for prosecution of the war against insurgency and other forms of criminality in the country.”
