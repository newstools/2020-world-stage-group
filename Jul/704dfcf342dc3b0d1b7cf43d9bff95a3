Manchester United and Chelsea booked their spots in next season’s Champions League but it was relegation for Bournemouth and Watford, despite valiant efforts on the final day. United needed just a point at Leicester to secure a top-four finish but Bruno Fernandes’ cool penalty and Jesse Lingard’s late goal helped them to a 2-0 win to grab third place in the Premier League table, level on 66 points with fourth-placed Chelsea, who beat Wolves 2-0 with two quickfire first-half injury-time goals. Fifth-placed Leicester, who had been in the top four for 298 days and only dropped to fifth in midweek, will go into the Europa League group stages along with Tottenham, after their point at Crystal Palace was enough to edge Wolves into seventh on goal difference. Nuno Espirito Santo’s side will now have to wait until the FA Cup final on August 1 to see whether they will be in Europe – an Arsenal win against Chelsea at Wembley would see the Gunners take the second qualifying-round place. It was misery at the other end of the table for Bournemouth and Watford. Eddie Howe’s side pulled off a brilliant and brave 3-1 win at Everton but it was not enough to lift them out of the drop zone because of Aston Villa’s nervy point at West Ham. Watford – who sacked Nigel Pearson two games ago – also fall into the Championship, finishing second-bottom and, like Bournemouth, just a point from safety, after going down 3-2 at Arsenal. Norwich – who lost 5-0 at Manchester City – had already been relegated. Elsewhere in the Premier League on the final day, champions Liverpool signed off with a 3-1 win at Newcastle, despite resting a number of star players, Man City’s big win over Norwich – in David Silva’s final Premier League game – also saw Ederson win the Golden Glove, with Burnley’s Nick Pope beaten in a 2-1 defeat to Brighton, and Southampton beat Sheffield United 3-1.
