Police in the Indonesian capital on Friday said they had arrested a French national for allegedly molesting over 300 minors. “The 65-year-old man, identified as Francois Camille Abello, invited the children to a Jakarta hotel. “He also paid them between 250,000 rupiah (17.30 dollars) and  1 million rupiah to have sex with him while being videotaped,’’ Jakarta police chief Nana Sujana said. Nana said that he physically abused the minors if they refused to have sex with him, adding that many of them were street children who were lured with the promise of modelling work. The suspect could face the death sentence if found guilty of raping multiple minors under the country’s child protection law. “When investigators raided his hotel room, he was found half-naked with two children,” Nana said. Evidence found in his hotel room included a laptop containing videos of his sex acts with 305 minors, police said.
