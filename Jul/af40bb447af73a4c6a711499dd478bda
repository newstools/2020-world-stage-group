YouTube said it has blocked three accounts linked to the right-wing extremist Identitarian movement, a spokesman for the video platform confirmed on Tuesday. This included the account of Austrian activist Martin Sellner, a leading figure in the pan-European movement, which promotes an ideology of ethnopluralism and has a particularly young following. The Identitarian branch in Germany, said to have around 600 members, is under surveillance by the domestic intelligence service. The YouTube bans came after Twitter blocked Sellner’s account at the weekend. Facebook and Instagram had already black-listed the group. The YouTube spokesman would not be drawn on the exact reasons for blocking the three accounts, and instead referred to the site’s terms of use. Sellner’s videos on YouTube appear as deleted with the note: “This video is no longer available because the YouTube account associated with this video has been closed.’’ On his website, Sellner vowed to take legal action against these unfounded closures. Around 100,000 people were subscribed to Sellner’s YouTube channel. On Twitter, he had just under 40,000 followers.
