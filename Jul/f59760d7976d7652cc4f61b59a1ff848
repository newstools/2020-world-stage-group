The World Health Organisation reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Saturday, with the total rising by 212,326 in 24 hours. The biggest increases were from the United States, Brazil and India, according to WHO’s daily report. The previous WHO record for new cases was 189,077 on June 28 and deaths have remained steady at about 5,000 a day. Global coronavirus cases exceeded 11 million on Friday, according to a Reuters tally, marking another milestone in the spread of the disease that has killed more than half a million people in seven months. 444,000 CONFIRMED CASES IN AFRICA The World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville, Congo, says there are currently over 444,000 confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Africa. The UN health agency gave the update on its regional official Twitter account @WHOAFRO. “There are over 444,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases on the African continent – with more than 214,000 recoveries and 10,800 deaths,’’ it said. The regional office stated that South Africa has 177,124 cases and 2,952 deaths, followed by Nigeria with 27,564 confirmed cases and 628 deaths, while Ghana has 18,892 confirmed cases and 117 deaths. It added that Gambia, Lesotho and Seychelles were countries currently with the lowest confirmed cases in the region as Gambia had 55 confirmed cases with two deaths. Lesotho had 63 reported cases and zero death, while Seychelles had 81 reported cases with no death, “the office said. Meanwhile, WHO in a statement posted on its website, it urged African countries to take strong safety measures against COVID-19 as they resumed air travel. “As African countries begin to reopen borders and air spaces, it is crucial that governments take effective measures to mitigate the risk of a surge in infections due to the resumption of commercial flights and airport operations. “Many African governments acted swiftly, implementing confinement and travel restrictions in the early days of the pandemic. “In the WHO African Region, 36 countries closed their borders to international travel, eight suspended flights from countries with high COVID-19 transmission and others had partial or no restrictions. “So far Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Tanzania and Zambia have resumed commercial flights. The 15-member Economic Community of West African States is expected to open their airspace on July 21. “While open borders are vital for the free flow of goods and people, initial analysis by WHO found that lockdowns along with public health measures reduced the spread of COVID-19.’’ The UN health agency said even with border restrictions, imported cases had sometimes brought back COVID-19 to countries which had not reported cases for a length of time. “For example, Seychelles had not had a locally transmitted case since April 6, 2020, but in the last week 66 new cases – all crew members of an international fishing vessel – have been recorded,’’ it said. The statement quouted Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, as saying: “Air travel is vital to the economic health of countries. “But as we take to the skies again, we cannot let our guard down. Our new normal still requires stringent measures to stem the spread of COVID-19.’’ To resume international air travel, WHO recommended that countries assess the epidemiological situation to determine whether maintaining restrictions outweighs the economic costs of reopening borders if, for instance, there is widespread transmission of the virus. “It is also crucial to determine whether the health system can cope with a spike in imported cases and whether the surveillance and contact tracing system can reliably detect and monitor cases.” According to the statement, it is important that countries have systems in place at points of entry including airports. “Comprehensive entry and exit screening should be considered based on risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis, and as part of the overall national response strategy. “Such screening may target, as a priority, direct flights from areas with community transmission. In addition, observance of preventive measures such as personal hygiene, cough etiquette, physical distancing remains crucial. “Passengers should be registered and followed up, and if they develop symptoms be advised to inform health authorities.’’ The statement further quoted Moeti, as saying: “The resumption of commercial flights in Africa will facilitate the delivery of crucial supplies such as testing kits. “It will also facilitate delivery of supplies such as personal protective equipment and other essential health commodities to areas which need them most. “It will also ensure that experts, who can support the response can finally get on the ground and work.” RUSSIA RECORDS 6,736 NEW CASES Russia recorded 6,736 new COVID-19 cases in the past 24 hours, taking its total to 681,251, the country’s coronavirus response centre said in a statement on Sunday.

MEXICO OVERTAKES FRANCE AT 30,366 DEATHS TALLY Mexico reported 523 more coronavirus deaths on Saturday, pushing its tally to 30,366, overtaking France to become the fifth-highest in the world. The health ministry also reported 6,914 new infections and a total of 252,165 confirmed cases. Deputy Health Minister Hugo Gatell reiterated that the actual number of infected was probably significantly higher. “We knew from the beginning that the cases we report here do not represent the total number of people with COVID-19 in Mexico,” he told a regular news conference. “Neither Mexico nor any other country in the world aims to make an exhaustive count.” Citing unpublished figures from the civil registry, broadcaster Milenio said that by June 19 almost twice as many people had died from the virus as reported by Gatell. Reuters was unable to immediately verify the information.  Nigeria has recorded 603 new COVID-19 cases in the country, as total infections from the virus climbed 28,167.
