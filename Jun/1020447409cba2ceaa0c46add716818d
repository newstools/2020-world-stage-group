WorldStage Newsonline– The Federal Government of Nigeria  has condemned the two attacks on its residential buildings in Accra, describing them as criminal and outrageous, demanding urgent action from the Ghanaian authorities. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama via his verified twitter handle @GeoffreyOnyeama on Sunday, said that the federal government was already engaging with the Ghanaian authorities to urgently bring the perpetrators to book and protect the lives of Nigerians in Ghana. The attack on Nigerian High Commission’s quarters in Accra was said to have happened in the early hours of June 20. Onyeama twitted, “We strongly condemn two outrageous criminal attacks in Accra, #Ghana, on a residential building in our diplomatic premises by unknown persons in which a bulldozer was used to demolish the building. “We are engaging with the Ghanaian government and we demand urgent action to find the perpetuators and provide adequate protection for Nigerians and their properties in Ghana.” Nigerians and their property have been severely attacked by the Ghanaians. The federal government has, however, been engaging with the Ghanaian authorities to put an end to the attacks.
