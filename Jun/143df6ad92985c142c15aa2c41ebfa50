Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Friday warned that Britons are “taking too many liberties” as crowded beach scenes were reported on Thursday. He urged the public to follow social distancing to avoid spikes in COVID-19 cases. Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof. Chris Whitty, also warned that people must follow social distancing guidance while enjoying the sunny weather, or “COVID-19 cases will rise again’’. “COVID-19 has gone down due to the efforts of everyone but is still in general circulation. “If we do not follow social distancing guidance, then cases will rise again. “Naturally, people will want to enjoy the sun but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all,’’ he said on Twitter.
