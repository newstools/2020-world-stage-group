Google is ending the trial program of a service that sent users algorithm-selected prints from their Google Photos libraries, Droid Life reported. The subscription-based service launched in the US in February with a monthly fee of $7.99 that got you 10 4×6 prints from the previous 30 days. The printing service allowed users to choose which themes the service should prioritize in selecting the prints, offering “people and pets,” “landscapes,” and “a little bit of everything” as options. Users were able to edit the selections before the photos were printed. Google sent a notice to subscribers that the service would not be available after June 30th, according to Droid Life: It’s not clear when or if Google will re-launch this service more widely in the future, or if it’s being shelved indefinitely. We’ve reached out to Google for more information.
