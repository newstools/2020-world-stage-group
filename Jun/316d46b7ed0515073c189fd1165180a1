Obayemi, an Assistant Corps Marshal, said: “Now, there will be increase in the number of people that want to make use of the road, having been shut indoor for quite sometime. We expect an increase in the volume of traffic. “Duly, we are going to discourage overloading. A lot of people will want to travel; our advice is that they should be careful of the vehicle they board and avoid travelling at night. “A lot of drivers will want to make as many trips as possible, just to satisfy the travellers and make more gains,” According to the FRSC chief, motorists should make sure that they have considerations for other road users. “Some drivers will want to overload and speed just to make up for the loss when they were not on the road. “A lot of people that had been locked up somewhere in various states would want to travel now. “So, drivers will want to take as many trips as possible. They must drive with care and high sense of safety to avoid crashes and unnecessary deaths. “Lives conserve from coronavirus should not be lost on the road,’’ Obayemi said. He urged commercial drivers to find time to rest and plan for each journey ahead, saying that all COVID-19 preventive guidelines and protocols must be adhered to in all interstate motor parks.
