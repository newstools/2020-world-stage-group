The government of Oyo State and the Oyo State Police Command have vowed to work harmoniously to ensure the arrest of killers of a pregnant woman, Azeezat Shomuyiwa and an 18-year-old student of Federal College of Animal Health and Production, Barakat Bello, who was raped and killed  in Akinyele Local Government Area of the state. A statement signed by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde, Mr. Taiwo Adisa, indicated that the Special Adviser to the governor on Security Matters,  Fatai Owoseni, a retired Commissioner of Police and the new Commissioner of Police in the state, Enwonwu  Nwachukwu made the vow while paying condolence visit to the families of the two victims on Friday.
The duo were unanimous in condemning the incidents, noting that the security agencies would soon fish out the perpetrators. Barely three days after young Barakat Bello was reportedly killed at Kara Area of Akinyele Local Government, another incident occurred in Ijefun near L. Adisa Quarry off Moniya-Oyo road, where Shomuyiwa, a postgraduate student of the University of Ibadan was killed by yet-to-be-identified persons. Owoseni and and the Commissioner of Police were told by members of the community that the late Shomuyiwa was hit with a big stone while inside her room. Residents also stated that the woman only returned from Kano in February, where her husband had just secured employment after completing his NYSC programme. The commissioner of police, Nwachukwu and the Owoseni assured families of the deceased that the perpetrators  would be brought to justice. The trio of CP Nwachukwu, retired COMPOL Owoseni as well as the Executive Assistant to Governor Makinde on Security,  Sunday Odukoya, also visited Akinyele where 18-year-old Barakat  was reportedly killed by unknown persons on Monday. They urged residents of the two communities to be security-conscious and to report any suspicious movement to the police for safety of lives and property.
