The Lagos Hoteliers Association (LHA), on Saturday solicited for palliatives from the Lagos State Government to cushion the effect of COVID-19 currently affecting the world. Its President, Mr Adekunle Akilo, made the plea in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Akilo said that the palliatives were equally needed to effect some renovations on the hotels in preparation toward resumption soon. According to him, the association had not received any form of palliative from the Lagos State Government and the Federal Government as individual hotelier suffered loss in the last three months of lockdown. “Hoteliers in Lagos have suffered serious loss due to COVID-19 and we have not received any form of palliative. We are in serious need of these palliatives. “We have written directly to the state government and have also written through the Federation of Tourism Association of Nigeria (FTAN). “Nothing has been done and we need this to renovate some of the hotels so that we can prepare well for resumption soon. “We have been out of business in the past three months and it has not been funny,” he said. Akilo said that there were ongoing preparations toward resumption as Hoteliers gradually put in place precautionary measures stated by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Federal Ministry of Health. He said hoteliers would not make any reasonable sales until restrictions on interstate travels and social activities were lifted.
