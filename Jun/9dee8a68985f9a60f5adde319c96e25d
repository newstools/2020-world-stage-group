The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) has urged Nigerians to report cases of  Rape within their vicinity to the agency or the nearest police station. Mrs Julie Okah-Donli,  Director General of the Agency, made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Abuja, following the rising cases of rape in the country. The DG said both old and present cases should be reported to the Agency. According to the her, reporting the case of rape is the only way the trend can be stopped in the society; the agency will not compromise its work for anything if such case is reported to it. “Rapists are now getting away with their illicit acts along with murder; these cases of domestic servitude are cases that take place behind  closed doors. “Our job in NAPTIP is to protect Nigerian men and women, we are not going to compromise our work if they report such case, we will ensure justice is done. “Rape cases are not reported because of stigmatisation of the victims and this makes the cases to rise. Very soon, the name of rapists will be published with their pictures in the media,” she said. She said that sex offender register had already been opened in the agency where the names of rape perpetrators were documented for further actions. Okah-Donli however, appealed to the media to assist in creating more awareness about this trend to put the perpetrators on alert.
