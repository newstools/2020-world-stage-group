The Federal Government is to establish fire response stations in the grassroots. Controller-General of the Federal Fire Service (FFS), Mr Liman Ibrahim, made this known in an interview with a correspondent of the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Abuja. Ibrahim told the NAN that the plan to establish the stations was to enhance the service’s prompt response to fire incidence in the senatorial districts. “When I came on board, we had one  fire station in each of the geo-political zones. We decided to increase it to 12 with three or less states making up a zone, and ensured that modern firefighting trucks and personnel  were also deployed to those zones. “As we speaks we are going beyond deployment to the zonal headquarters, but to every state of the Federation. “The Minister of Interior, Mr Rauf Aregbesola recently inaugurated 10 modern fire trucks,  and those trucks will also be deployed to state command. “We have also established training schools in each of the geopolitical political zones, knowing quite well that capacity building is key in fire fighting,”he said. The controller-general said that the plan would aid response to emergencies at the grassroots as well as  reduce loss of lives and property to fire outbreaks. On Nigeria’s celebration of the  Democracy Day, Ibrahim enjoined  Nigerians to unite and support the government because governance was a collective responsibility. “As a growing democracy, all hands must be on deck to make this country better for all. “Everyone must contribute his or her quota in making this nation great because we have no other country other than Nigeria. “We may have our challenges at the moment, but collectively we will surmount them all. “The Government, I must say is doing it’s best in ensuring the safety and unity of the country, but it is obvious we are not there yet,” he said.
