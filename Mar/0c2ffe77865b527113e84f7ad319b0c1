The government of Kaduna Stat has directed that all public and private schools should be closed down with immediate effect to prevent the transmission of Coronavirus. The Commissioner for Education, Dr Shehu Makarfi who disclosed this in Kaduna on Friday, said the measure was in line with the directive of Gov. Nasir El-Rufa’i. Makarfi said that the schools would remain close but might be reopen in 30 days if the current level of the virus infection in the country is brought under control. “We have directed all our schools to close down immediately to prevent the spread of the dreaded virus, particularly among our children. “We are appealing to parents to take preventive measures as being announced in all communication channels to keep the children from becoming infected,” the commissioner said. Similarly, the state Secretary, National Association of Proprietors of Private School, Mr Philip Henas, also said that the association had received the directive from the ministry. Henas said that the association had already directed all private school owners in the state to comply. The state government had earlier announced the restriction of large gatherings in the state, including religious and social events. The government said in a statement signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication, Mr Muyiwa Adekeye, that the measure was to prevent the spread of the virus. The statement noted that while no case of COVID-19 had been reported in the state, the government had a duty to prevent the chances of the virus finding its way into the state. “As part of the required containment measures, the state government has directed the closure of all nursery, primary and secondary schools, including tertiary institutions.
