Operatives of the Kaduna Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), have arrested one Obi Sobenna Jude and Robert Sunday Olaoluwa, for defrauding unsuspecting members of the public, through job scam, by posing as foreigners working for American companies on the internet. The intelligence report was received and acted on by the Intelligence and Special Operations Section, ISOS, of the Kaduna zone. Upon receipt of the intel, operatives swung into action and stormed the residence of the suspects on February 29, 2020, at New GRA, Bayan Gida Yerima Gyade, Bauchi State where they were arrested. Under cross-examination, they confessed to the fact that they had been using different techniques to defraud their victims, pricipally through the website: snagajob.com (a supposed job advert platform), where they posed as hiring managers of TTEC, reputable company in USA and paxful.com (another supposed platform) for trading bitcoins. A search executed at their residence, also led to the recovery of a Toyota Camry salon car, a Sumec Firman Generator, two laptops (one HP and one Dell model), one iPhone 8+, one Samsung S8, one Tecno KC8, one Tecno F3, one Vivo Y37 and 4 ATM cards. Analysis of their emails, text messages, chats and calls further confirmed the intelligence report as there were series of conversions between the suspects, their accomplices and victims with regards to their heinous acts of defrauding members of the public while sending fake offer letters to their victims. They will soon be arraigned in court.
