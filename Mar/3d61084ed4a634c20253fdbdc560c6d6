Nigeria’s former vice-president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar has confirmed that his son has tested positive for the coronavirus. He tweeted on Sunday night, “My son has tested positive for coronavirus.” Atiku however did not mention which of the sons tested for COVID 19 and whether he was infected from outside Nigeria before the border was closed. He only informed that the @NCDCGov (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control) had been duly informed, and “he has been moved to Gwagwalada Specialist Teaching Hospital in Abuja for treatment and management. “I will appreciate it if you have him in your prayers. Stay safe, coronavirus is real.”
