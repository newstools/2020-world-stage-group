The Ondo State Government has urged residents to steer clear of Saturday’s explosion site at Ilu Abo on the Akure-Owo express way. A truck laden with dynamites being transported to Edo from Lagos State had developed a fault and exploded around 1am. Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, who visited the scene of the explosion on Saturday, said the destruction caused by the explosion could only be imagined, advising residents to allow the bomb squad to do its job. “I have had thorough briefing from head of our security agencies and the preliminary reports received was that it was an accidental discharge of explosives that was in transit through Ondo state to another state where it was needed. “We will advise all citizens, all residents of Ondo State, not to come near this place at all, they should vacate and move out of this premises. “As we are told, the vehicle that was carrying this explosives is buried in the crater it created, so we never know what number of explosives are left. “Let everybody give the police, the bomb squad, space to do their work and we will know what to do,” he said. He urged residents not to forget that the coronavirus was still raging, urging residents to avoid crowded areas.
