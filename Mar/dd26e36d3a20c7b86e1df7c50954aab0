Germany is making 50 million euros (55.66 million dollars) available to repatriate German tourists stranded around the world by the coronavirus-induced collapse in air transport, an official said. The Foreign Minister, Heiko Maas, said this at a news conference on Tuesday in Berlin. Repatriation flights were planned for tourists now stranded in Morocco, the Dominican Republic, the Philippines and the Maldives, he said. The minister added that the government expected worldwide air passenger volumes to stay at a very low level for the foreseeable future. “We don’t want to see further tourists stranded abroad,” he said. “For this reason we have decided to issue a warning against all touristic trips abroad. Please stay at home.”
