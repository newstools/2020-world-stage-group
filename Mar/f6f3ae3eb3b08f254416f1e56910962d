CURRENCY: At the IEFX window, the Naira gained 1.72% against USD to close at N385.55. At the parallel market, the Naira closed flat against USD, GBP and EUR at N415, N490 and N420 respectively. Going forward, we expect the FX market to be dictated by heightened dollar demand and CBN FX policies. FIXED INCOME: Money market rates fell today as Open Buy Back and Overnight rates declined by 633bps and 550bps to close at 8.50% and 9.83% respectively. The decline in rates may be as a result of refunds from yesterday’s FX auction which may have improved system liquidity. The bond market was positive today as yields declined across most maturities. While the yields on the 5yr and 10yr benchmark bonds declined by 1bp and 43bps to close at 11.75% and 12.75% respectively, the yield on 7yr the  benchmark bond remained flat closing at 12.54%. In the near term, we expect market activity to be influenced by liquidity levels and foreign investor participation.
