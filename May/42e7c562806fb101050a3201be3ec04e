The Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with government and people of Lagos State over the passing of Justice Isiaka Isola Oluwa, ”whose legacy of fairness, integrity and forthrightness in administering justice continues to reverberate long after retirement.” In a condolence message released by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Sunday, President Buhari condoled with the family of the late Justice of the State High Court, his friends and professional colleagues. He affirmed that Oluwa’s meritorious public service was most remarkable, especially his contributions to the growth of education as Pro-Chancellor of Lagos State University and Chairman of Governing Council. According to him, Justice Oluwa’s personal attributes of simple, disciplined and incorruptible lifestyle left an indelible mark on the Lagos State Judiciary, and enabled his subsequent appointments to sensitive positions. He, therefore, urged the Lagos state government, particularly the Ministry of Justice to institutionalize the good works of the legal luminary, who died at the age of 102.
