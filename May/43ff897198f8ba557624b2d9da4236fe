The government of Kwara State has commenced the reconnection of more than 12 border communities to the national grid, five years after vandals carted away cables providing electricity to the area. Alhaji Aliyu Kora-Sabi, the state Commissioner for Energy, who disclosed this on Sunday in Ilorin said the work involved the rehabilitation of electric poles and power lines from Ilesha-Baruba to Chikanda in Baruten Local Government Area. Kora-Sabi said that the project, which began on May 4, would cost the state government N11 million. “About 12 communities along the route will be hooked to the national grid at the completion of the project, which is expected to finish in three weeks based on our projections,” he said. The commissioner also announced plan to build an injection power substation at Ilesha-Baruba for steady and interrupted power supply to the area. “We are working on injection substation in Ilesha-Baruba and the governor has contacted the Director-General of the Transmission Company of Nigeria over the matter. “Survey plan and other things have been done in preparation for the work,” he added.
