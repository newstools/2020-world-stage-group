The day is simply set to honour children and minors,” Makinde said. He regretted that the present reality caused by the novel Coronavirus outbreak, had impeded any funfair the State Government may have planned for the children. “We sincerely love you, but in the face of the present situation of the Coronavirus in the country, it is impossible to gather for celebrations,” “As we pray for God’s protection, may we all live to witness and celebrate the 2021 Children’s Day and beyond, in good health, peace and progress in every area of our lives,” he prayed. He reassured children of the State Government’s commitment to fulfilling its promise of a better and prosperous future, through free and quality education. The governor however opined that the task of training up a child should not be left to the government alone. He therefore called on parents to play significant roles in shaping the future of their children and wards.
