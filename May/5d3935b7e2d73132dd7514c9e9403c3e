The World Bank said its board of executive directors has approved $48 million to help Uganda fight a desert locust invasion threatening livelihoods. The funds, under the Emergency Locust Response Programme, will help Uganda monitor and manage locust swarms to limit the growth of existing and new desert locust populations, the bank said in a statement. The funds will also provide livelihood protection and restoration to the affected households, communities and vulnerable groups. “The project is expected to support 950,000 direct beneficiaries and about 1.2 million indirect beneficiaries in the locust-affected districts,’’ the bank said. “The outbreak could undermine development gains and threaten the food security and livelihoods of millions of Ugandans.’’ With support from other development partners, Uganda has started the fight against the migratory insects. The country deployed over 2,000 soldiers and 835 civilian personnel, including agriculture extension workers, to contain the locusts.
