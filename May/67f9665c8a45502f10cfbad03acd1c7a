Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq on Tuesday commiserated with the Patigi community and the APC family over the sudden death of Mr. James Kolo, a commissioner-designate of the Federal Character Commission (FCC). AbdulRazaq described Kolo as a loyal party man and a team player whose death Tuesday morning is a great loss to his family, the people of Patigi local government, and the entire state. “We are devastated by the death of Mr. Kolo after recently falling ill. He was a staunch party man and a bridge builder who worked hard alongside other patriots for the success of the APC in the state,” the Governor said in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Rafiu Ajakaye. “We are consoled by the fact that he was a good man who got along with everybody that crossed his path. Many knew him for being a generous person. We commiserate with his family and pray the Almighty God to comfort them and rest his gentle soul.”
