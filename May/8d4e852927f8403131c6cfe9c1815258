The equities market closed down today due to the losses recorded in most sectors. While we believe the risk-off sentiment could have caused the recent sell-off in the market, we retain our stance that this may be one of the best periods to pick up some quality names with a medium to long term horizon. CURRENCY: At the IEFX window, the Naira lost 0.68%, 0.49% and 0.46% against the GBP, USD and EUR to close at N481.25, N386.38 and N420.10 respectively. At the parallel market, while the Naira lost 1.80% and 2.27% against USD and EUR  to close at N445 and  N450 respectively, It remained flat against GBP closing at N530 . Going forward, we expect the FX market to be dictated by heightened dollar demand and CBN FX policies.

As such, the yields on the 5yr, 7yr  and 10yr benchmark bonds remained flat closing at flat 9.36%, 11.18% and 10.88% respectively. In the near term, we expect market activity to be influenced by liquidity levels and foreign investor participation.
