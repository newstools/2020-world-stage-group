Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq has directed the drilling and completion of at least 14 motorised boreholes in various parts of Baruten local government area of the state to further ease water scarcity there, an official has said. Commissioner for Water Resources Hajia Fatimah Arinola Lawal said during a visit to Baruten over the weekend that the motorised boreholes are being located at Gure, Kosubosu, Geasoro, Okuta, Taberu, Ngurume, Ilesha Baruba, Shiya, and Boriya. The boreholes will complement the existing water works the administration has put in place, she added. Hajia Arinola said the government will also complete the rehabilitation of the Yashikira water works by May 29. The administration has so far fixed five major water works across the state including Asa Dam (Central); Patigi (North); Gwanara (North); Lafiagi (North); and Igbaja (South). “The directive of the Governor is that these motorised boreholes should be ready by the end of this month,” Arinola said, asserting that the administration has clearly changed the narrative about water situation in the state. Hajia Arinola said the ministry has also been directed to fix the burst pipes and reticulation work in Igbaja town and Lafiagi, adding that the government will embark on more reticulation in the year as captured in the 2020 budget, She said motorised boreholes would also be drilled in some areas of the state capital such as Ita Koko, Ita Elepa by Offa Garage (Ilorin), Adefalu, Aliara village, and rehabilitation of some boreholes at Alanamu area by the end of the month. “In addition to that, there will also be rehabilitation of the ductile pipe at Alagbado bridge before the end of the month.
