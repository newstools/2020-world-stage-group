WorldStage Newsonline– Free Zone Stakeholders have asked the Federal Government to urgently investigate what they alleged the ‘fraudulent misrepresentation’ of the Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Authority (OGEFZA), by the Umana Okon Umana led Management, and also bring the management to book, over its activities in trying to sabotage the economy of Nigeria by creating chaos among investors in the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) approved Free Zones which they said, may lead to investors pulling out their investments. This is just as they noted, that the compulsory take-over of the regulatory affairs of Free Zones licensed by NEPZA without appropriate legislative amendments and due process will unsettle investors and lead to attendant financial losses for stakeholders and the country. The stakeholders disclose this  in a statement titled, “Economic sabotage by the Umana Okon Umana led Management of Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Authority (OGEFZA) Against Select Free Zones licensed by Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA)”. The Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Act Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2010 (Act) unambiguously established Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Authority (OGEFZA) to manage and operate a designated Oil and Gas Export Free Zone at Onne/Ikpokiri area of Rivers State, they stressed that since the enactment of the Act, there has been no amendment to the Act by the National Assembly either by changing Oil and Gas Export Free Zone Authority to Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority (which is the current name being used by the Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA) or extending the regulatory jurisdiction of OGEFZA beyond the designated Oil and Gas Export Free Zone at Onne/Ikpokiri area of Rivers State of Nigeria. According to the stakeholders, despite the fact that the provisions of the Act have not been amended and the law still restricts the regulatory functions of OGEFZA to Onne/Ikpokiri area of Rivers State, the Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA has continued to violate the express provisions of the Act by licensing other Free Zones like Brass Oil and Gas City, Warri Oil and Gas Free Zone, Eko Support Services etc, which are located outside the designated Oil and Gas Export Free Zone at Onne/Ikpokiri area of Rivers State. “The latest attempt by the Umana Okon Umana-led Management of OGEFZA is to surreptitiously take over the operations of some Free Zones already within the regulatory control of NEPZA without recourse to due process or any legislative amendment to that effect,” the statement said. “The Federal Government has done a lot of work in the area of “Ease of Doing Business” with the sole aim of making the business environment attractive to both local and foreign investors but with the continued mischievous activities of the Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA, a lot of investors in the country and other prospective investors would begin to doubt the sincerity of the Federal Government in its drive towards “Ease of Doing Business”.” They further explained that, “In an attempt to perfect its plans, the Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA has consistently misrepresented OGEFZA to the general public and in several public fora with government officials in attendance as “Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority (OGFZA)”. The Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA has unilaterally, illegally and deliberately expunged from the name of OGEFZA the word “Export” and replaced the word “Zone” with “Zones” contrary to the extant legislation of the National Assembly of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in a move that appears to be borne out of executive recklessness and lawlessness. “The Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA in doing this, is trying to perpetrate its selfish agenda and deceive the unsuspecting public that OGEFZA has more powers than that arrogated to it by the Act. OGEZFA wants the public to believe that it has the power and authority over other “Zones” apart from the only statutorily designated Export Free Zone area located in Onne/Ikpokiri area of Rivers State. “This reckless and unlawful act is even evident from OGEFZA’s website: www.ogfza.gov.ng and its official correspondence. If this reckless and unlawful act being perpetrated by the Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA is not checked timeously by the Federal Government, it will have the tendency to mislead and deceive the unsuspecting general public and investors at large who do not have the historical background of OGEFZA”, the stakeholders reiterated. They emphasized that the only constitutionally recognized authority saddled with the responsibility of interpretation of laws in Nigeria remains the Judiciary, adding that any attempt by any person or authority to usurp the constitutional role of the court, as is being attempted by the Umana Okon Umana led Management of OGEFZA should be outrightly rebuked and investigated in the interest of Nigeria’s democracy, good governance and more importantly the rule of law While reiterating the call on the federal government to investigate the Umana Okon Umana  Management of OGEFZA, the stakeholders declared that Federal Government’s inaction on the matter is capable of bringing its name and  integrity into utter disrepute as it will appear that OGEFZA has the backing and endorsement of the Federal Government in its fraudulent activities. They noted also that if the need for any regulatory review arises, the operators within the Free Zones licensed by NEPZA would make adequate representation to the appropriate authorities, adding that stakeholders within the industry have not complained about the existing legislative framework pursuant to which billions of dollars in investments have been committed by financial institutions (both local and foreign) and other trade partners
