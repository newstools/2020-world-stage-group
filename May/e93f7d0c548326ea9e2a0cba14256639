As part of efforts to ensure food security in the country,  Gov. Ben Ayade of Cross River on Friday inaugurated the 2020 Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) wet season rice cultivation in Ugep, Yakurr Local Government Area of the state. Inaugurating the wet season rice farming, Ayade urged RIFAN members in the state to take advantage of the mechanised farm equipment procured by the state for land preparation and development. Ayade, who was represented by the state Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Okon Owuna, said all was set to ensure that the farmers record high yield. “We have high breed rice seedlings at the Cross River Rice Seedling Factory in the Ayade Industrial Park to boost your farming activities and enhance rice production. “The Cross River Ultra-Modern Rice Processing Plant in Ogoja is near completion and ready to off-take all your rice paddy for processing and towards ensuring food security in Nigeria,’’ he said. The governor also used the opportunity to distribute agro inputs such as fertilisers and chemicals to rice farmers at the Central Senatorial District of the state. Responding, the paramount rulers of Yakurr and Abi LGA, Ofem Ubana and Solomon Edward thanked the governor for his agro-industrial revolution in the state.
