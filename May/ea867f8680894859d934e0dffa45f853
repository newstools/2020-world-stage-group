Italy’s economy may shrink by up to 13 per cent this year as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic, National Central Bank Governor, Ignazio Visco, said on Friday. “In the baseline scenario, the fall in production in 2020 would be equal to 9 per cent,’’Visco said in an annual speech. “A second scenario based on more pessimistic, though not extreme, assumptions  would see GDP fall by 13 per cent this year, and a much slower recovery in 2021,’’ he added. Visco’s warning came as National Statistics Agency, Istat, made a downward revision in Gross Domestic Product  (GDP) growth estimates for the first quarter. GDP fell by 5.3 per cent on a quarterly, seasonal and calendar adjusted basis, Istat said, rather than by the 4.7 per cent estimate on April 30. Half of the Italian recession is due to virus lockdown measures, while the other half stems from falling world trade and the collapse of tourism flows, the Bank of Italy chief said. He estimated that Italy’s deficit would jump to 10.4 per cent of GDP, from 1.6 per cent last year, and public debt would soar by 21 percentage points, to 156 per cent of GDP. “One thing is certain after the pandemic; there will be much higher levels of public and private debt and greater inequalities, not only of the economic kind,’’ Visco said.
