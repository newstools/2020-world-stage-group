WorldStage Newsonline– Okomuoil has released its first quarter (Q1) 2020 result with a 65.5% y/y increase in revenue, primarily driven by crude palm oil (CPO) volume expansion, while Earnings per stock (EPS) grew by 101.4% y/y. When annualized, the reported EPS for the period is only 2.0% below our full year 2020 estimate and 20% below Bloomberg consensus estimates. Okomuoil’s CPO production is entering a new growth phase, with a total of c.9,000 hectares of mature plantation coming on stream between 2020 and 2021 from its Extension II. Okomuoil delivered a 65.5% y/y topline growth in Q1-20, supported by higher CPO sales (+81.6% y/y), which was more than enough to offset lower rubber revenue (-12.5% y/y). On the former, analysts believed that the blend of higher volume growth and stronger selling prices were notable drivers of the sturdy outturn. On CPO prices, it was believed the closure of all land borders by the FGN, which materially reduced the influence of smugglers of cheaper CPO, ensured that higher global CPO prices, cascaded favourably into domestic prices (+4.4% y/y) in the period. Management disclosed that volume grew by 90.7% y/y, mostly on higher mature acreages from extension OKOMU II. For rubber, the decline in sales was driven by a combination of lower rubber prices and volumes. On volume,  Okomuoil’s rubber production is believed to have hit its peak in 2019 as the company plants an additional c.1,500 hectares, to fully exhaust total land area under rubber plantation. Thus, rubber production is expected to remain largely tame in the near term. Since Okomuoil exports all rubber produced, it’s believed the lower average price realized, largely reflects the benign movement in global rubber prices (-4.6% y/y). Okomuoil reported sequential improvement in gross margin in Q1-20 (96.4% vs. -10.4% in Q4-19), which is mostly driven by a seven-fold q/q reduction in COGS. From a year ago, gross margin improved by 16pps y/y, following a sharp decline in COGS (-69.9% y/y). Despite a 71.0% y/y expansion in OPEX, Okomuoil delivered a 15.0ppts y/y increase in EBIT margin. Overall, EPS grew by 101.4% y/y, masking the surge in interest expense (+153.7% y/y) and higher effective taxes (+12.0ppts y/y). Meanwhile,  lower CPO prices pose the biggest threat to Okomuoil earnings through the rest of the year. YTD global CPO prices have fallen 26.2%, largely driven by benign global CPO demand, occasioned by the outbreak of COVID-19. Going forward, lower global CPO prices is now expected to reflect in Okomuoil ’s selling prices. The average selling price for the company is expected to decline by 18.8% y/y over 2020E. On volume, management said it does not anticipate the impact of economic disruptions from COVID-19 to impact its sales volume as evident from its near doubling of volume growth in Q1 alone. The company produced 15,510MT in Q1-20 vs. 8,134MT in Q1-29. When annualized, the reported volume produced is only 3.4 below our 2020FY estimates. On balance, revenue is now expected to print NGN20.8 billion (+10.2% y/y) over 2020E.
