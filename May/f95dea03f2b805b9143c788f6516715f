German carmaker Volkswagen plans to resume production at its plant in the U.S. state of Tennessee, it said in a statement Wednesday. The company said it has implemented more than 90 new health and safety measures ahead of a gradual ramp-up of operations starting on May 17. Some 3,800 Volkswagen employees at the plant have not worked since it suspended operations on March 21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Safety precautions include mandatory temperature checks on everyone who enters the factory. Anyone with a temperature above 38.1 degrees will not be allowed in. Masks, gloves and sanitising stations will be made available for all employees. Doors will be left open to avoid touchp oints, and all ice machines will be closed. The company will also stagger shift and break start times and will set up partitions in all break and work areas. Volkswagen has gradually resumed production at plants in Germany and Europe, including in the companyâ€™s home city of Wolfsburg.
