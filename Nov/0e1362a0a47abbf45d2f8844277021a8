The United Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF,  says it has received 2.9 million U.S. dollars from the Global Partnership for Education (GPE) to bolster education in Somalia. UNICEF said the fund would enhance access and improve the quality of basic education for crisis-affected children in Puntland, northeast Somalia. UNICEF said the new funding, which comes amid the COVID-19 pandemic, would play an integral part in supporting the UN agency. It said the Puntland Ministry of Education and partners would work together to increase equitable access to education, improve the quality of education and strengthen education management systems in Puntland. “This new funding will not only help to give more children the opportunity to go to school but also equip them with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life,’’ said Jesper Moller, UNICEF Somalia Representative ad interim. The funds would help improve learning conditions in the schools, train teachers and mobilise, enroll and retain children in school. They would also support efforts to make schools safer for girls and boys, including children with disabilities. The new 2.9 million dollar contribution brings GPE’s funding to Puntland to a total of 13 million dollars for 2020, including 8.8 million dollars to support the education sector and 1.3 million dollars for COVID-19 response in the state. GPE CEO, Alice Albright, said support for educating children in Puntland was more critical now than ever before. “Families, schools and governments are struggling to cope with the impact of the pandemic. “This funding will help get more children in school and learning,’’ she said. Bashir Jama Mohamed, acting minister of Puntland Ministry of Education and Higher Education, said the continued support from the GPE had provided the regional state opportunity to save guard children, particularly the most vulnerable ones and give them a chance to learn.
