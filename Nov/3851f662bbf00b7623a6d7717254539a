Digital transformation leader, Globacom, has rolled out data gifts, including a one-off 10GB free data, for its subscribers on 3G SIMs to encourage them to upgrade to 4G SIMs to experience its faster 4G LTE network. Globacom launched its 4G LTE network nationwide in October 2016 and has since consolidated the reach, taking the network to more smaller cities and towns across the country. A statement from the companyâ€™s headquarters in Lagos said in addition to the one-off 10 GB data that customers will get upon upgrading their 3G SIM to 4G SIM, they will also get 25 percent extra data on subsequent data purchases ranging between N500 and N5000 for the next 6 months. The company said the 10 GB free data will be valid for 7 days, while the validity of the 25 percent extra data will be determined by the data bundle purchased by the customer. Globacom subscribers who desire to swap their 3G SIMs for 4G SIMs will be able to do so at any Gloworld, Glozone or SIM Swap outlet across the country. The telecom company also explained that the upgrade will not affect whatever tariff plan the customer has opted for. They will enjoy the benefits of their preferred tariff profile in addition to the benefits accruing to the 4G SIM upgrade.
