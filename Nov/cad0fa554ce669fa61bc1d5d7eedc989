WorldStage Newsonline– The Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Pantami, has said the newly commissioned National Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (NCAIR) will enable diversification of the economy and create more jobs. Dr. Pantami who disclosed this at the official commissioning ceremony of the NCAIR in Abuja, said the centre will serve as a leading hub of innovation, research and development, knowledge transfer, and training in the areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics and other emerging technologies. He said, “Our adoption of regulatory sandbox frameworks for testing technology in a controlled environment will enable the centre accelerate the progress we are making in the development of our digital economy. “This project is one among many of our developmental programmes in accordance with NITDA’s core mandate of facilitating the growth of Information Technology (IT) development in Nigeria. We are focused on providing support for viable innovations with socio-economic impact as well as a level playing field for all Nigerians to thrive in. “As we enter the age of advanced technological breakthroughs such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Nigeria cannot be left out in harnessing the advantages of AI, Robotics and other emerging technologies. “AI has the potential to add to economic growth but the impact may be gradual and take sometimes to manifest according to McKinsey Global Institute. Develop countries can add 20 to 25% net income to their GDP while developing countries like Nigeria can add 5 to 15%. Nigerian GDP is around 400B USD thus AI can add between 20B to 60B USD in 10 years. This centre is aimed at achieving such unprecedented boost to our economy.”
