It was introduced in Nigeria with the enactment of VAT Act No. 102 of 1993, which replaced the Sales Tax, which had been in operation since 1986 by virtue of the Federal Government Decree No. 7 of 1986. VAT used to be five per cent, however, on Jan. 13, it was reviewed to 7.5 per cent after President Muhammadu Buhari signed the Finance Act 2020 into law, formerly known as the Finance Bill 2019.
