While many airlines are down-sizing their operations due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic, Ethiopian Airlines is adding new aircraft and expanding businesses, according to officials of the state-owned enterprise. “This shows that Ethiopian Airlines is founded on a strong vision, capacity to execute its vision even though it has similar challenges to other airlines,” said Chief Operating Officer Mesfin Tasew. The company on Saturday took delivery of two of the 10 new Airbuses A350-900 it ordered in 2017, bringing the total number of its Airbus fleet to 16. According to Tasew, the airline has been operating A350-900 planes for the last four years. Ethiopian is taking delivery of these aircraft at a time when the entire air transport industry is under a big challenge caused by Covid-19, he said. He pointed out that Ethiopian had transported around five tons of humanitarian aid, medical supplies and IT equipment from France to Addis Ababa in partnership with Airbus Foundation and other European donors. The humanitarian aid, medical supplies and equipment, were delivered to Ethiopia’s Ministry of Health and a humanitarian organisation which runs a children’s hospital in Ethiopia. Meanwhile, Health State Minister Seharela Abdullahi, said this kind of support is crucial in countries with poor infrastructure such as Ethiopia. Citing the critical role played by Ethiopian Airlines since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, she added, “I would like to thank Ethiopian Airlines for their tremendous support in the fight against Covid-19.”
