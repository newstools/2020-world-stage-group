Chinese tech giant Huawei, one of the biggest makers of smartphones and switching equipment, said Friday its revenue rose 9.9 per cent in the first nine months of this year. In August, Washington prohibited Huawei from buying any semi  conductor chips made with U.S software or technology, putting the smartphone maker in a bind. On Thursday, Huawei launched its new Mate 40 phone. Chinese companies haven’t yet been able to produce similarly advanced chips, experts say.
