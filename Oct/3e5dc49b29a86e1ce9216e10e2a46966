This is rather unfortunate as we believe far reaching reform is necessary and we have said as much on a number of occasions across our platforms. “In the process of change, some pain will be borne by all and some anger may well be misdirected. We understand this as a part of the process of the struggle. “We have a large staff strength and an even larger customer base who may be affected by any disruption and this would be a pity as a number are also contributing in many ways to ensure that voices are heard and required action is taken. “We have been consistent in our message on the need to end all brutality and carry out necessary reforms. We will continue to lend our voice accordingly. “
