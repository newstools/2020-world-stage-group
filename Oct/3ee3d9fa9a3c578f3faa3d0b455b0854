Amaechi said that the transition period between now and January would enable the Federal Government acquire Right of Way for Lagos-Ibadan route. He said that it could be difficult to embark on perimeters fencing, adding that the fence constructed in Warri had been pulled down by hoodlums.

Musa said that the standard gauge between Lagos and Ibadan was the first moving train compared to the narrow gauge that the country had in the past. Musa said that although people were still asking for more access to the corridor, they however would be considered based on merit and the finances available on ground.
