Japan’s Nissan Motor Co. will increase its output capacity in China from 2021owing to the world’s second-largest economy having been among the swiftest to recover from the novel coronavirus pandemic, a Nissan official said on Tuesday. According to the official, the Japanese automaker is aiming to produce more vehicles at two plants of its Chinese joint venture Dongfeng Motor Corp. in China, the world’s largest auto market. One of the plants is in Wuhan in Hubei Province, and the other is in Changzhou in Jiangsu Province, the official said. Nissan is aiming not only to increase its production hubs in China by two to six, but to introduce new models as a means to bolster sales. The official said Nissan would sell its Ariya electric sport utility vehicle, which incorporates self-driving assistance technology that enables hands-off driving while cruising on highways in 2021, with plans to rollout nine new models specifically for the Chinese market by 2025. Japan’s third-largest automaker has said that while streamlining operations in Europe and Southeast Asia, including shuttering some plants, it will reallocate its resources and focus more on its domestic, Chinese and U.S. markets.
