WorldStage Newsonline– President Muhammadu Buhari has again condemned hate messages and eviction notices to ethnic and religious groups as a result of the consequences of the EndSARS protests in some parts of the country. The president, in a statement issued by his Spokesman, Malam Garba Shehu, however, frowned at such eviction notices and hate messages, saying that Nigerians must be their brothers’ keepers and shun any act capable of causing social discontent. He also asked Nigerians to take pride in the fact that ”our diverse people have been living with one another in harmony for ages”. According to Buhari, the right of all citizens to live and work in any part of the country is a constitutional one and will be defended by the government. He also expressed optimism that the judicial panel of inquiry set up by the Lagos State government would assist the nation to give justice to the peaceful protesters who lost their lives. The president expressed the hope that the security personnel, who were murdered and the property owners, whose assets were vandalised and looted, would be treated justly and fairly.
