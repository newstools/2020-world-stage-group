WorldStage Newsonline– President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Dr Funmi Adewara, a UK-based Nigerian Medical Doctor on winning World Bank SDGs And Her Global Award 2020. The president, in a congratulatory message by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Friday said this feat has hoisted Nigeria’s flag proudly in the international arena once again. The award came in the same season that the President in his National Day broadcast just applauded Nigerian professionals at home and abroad, whom he said ranked among the very best in the world. Adewara is one of the seven winners of the award globally, among 2,400 women. Buhari described this feat as “an attestation once again of the stuff Nigerian professionals are made of.” He praised the University of Ibadan and Cambridge University trained medical doctor for her illustrious work in promoting access to healthcare for the world’s population in line with SDG 3 that seeks to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being of all ages. Adewara is Chief Executive Officer of Africa’s first fully integrated telehealth startup leveraging technology in harnessing diaspora and local doctors through a secure electronic medical record and video software.
