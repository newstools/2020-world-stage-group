In a notice at the Nigerian Stock Exchange, the group said its Board of Directors had earlier scheduled its meeting to hold on October 23, 2020, but was constrained to postpone the meeting with a “No Objection” confirmation from the NSE in view of the current situation in Nigeria. “Considering the Nigeria Stock Exchange’s recent extension of time to file financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2020, the Board meeting will now hold on Thursday, November 5, 2020,” the group said. The cement maker said the ongoing closed trading period will continue until 24 hours after the relevant resolutions taken at the said Board meeting, are released to the public.
