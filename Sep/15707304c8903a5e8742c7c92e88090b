WorldStage Newsonline– With only one local governments’ results yet to be released, Governor Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has secured victory in the 2020 Edo governorship election. He gathered 307955 votes to defeat Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who scored 223619 votes  from the results of the 17 Local Governments declared so far by the Independent National Electoral Commission. A total of 17 political parties fielded candidates for the election, but the real contest was  between All Progressives Congress and PDP. Incumbent Governor Obaseki of PDP ran against APC standard-bearer Osagie Ize-Iyamu. Obaseki was elected on APC’s platform in 2016 but defected to the PDP after being denied the ticket owing to intra-party squabbles. The PDP scored 302,017 while APC had 212,983 votes from the declared results in the 17 LGAs. Obaseki is leading Ize-Iyamu by a wide margin of over 85,000 votes.
