Liverpool have completed the signing of Portugal forward Diogo Jota from Wolverhampton Wanderers on a long term contract, the English Premier League (EPL) champions said on Saturday. Liverpool’s versatile 18-year-old defender Ki-Jana Hoever moved in the other direction on a five-year contract. He played four senior games for the Anfield club following his arrival from Ajax Amsterdam in 2018. British media reported that Liverpool agreed a five-year deal worth about 41 million pounds for Jota. It is expected that his versatility and work rate should fit in well with manager Juergen Klopp’s hard-pressing style of play.
