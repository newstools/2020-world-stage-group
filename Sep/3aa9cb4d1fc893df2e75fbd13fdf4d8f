The chief executive of Swiss International Air Lines, Thomas Kluehr, will step down at the end of 2020, the Lufthansa subsidiary announced on Tuesday. Kluehr has steered Swiss since 2016, after holding various senior management positions at German carrier Lufthansa. A successor is set to be selected during the fourth quarter. According to the Swiss statement, Kluehr had originally planned to leave already in March for personal reasons but decided to stay on for the rest of the year to handle the COVID-19 crisis. Lufthansaâ€™s subsidiaries in Switzerland were rescued in May, when the parliament in Bern approved state-backed loans worth 1.5 billion Swiss francs (1.6 billion dollars) for Swiss and its sister airline, Edelweiss. Deutsche Lufthansa AG, commonly known as Lufthansa, is the largest German airline which, when combined with its subsidiaries, is the second largest airline in Europe in terms of passengers carried.
