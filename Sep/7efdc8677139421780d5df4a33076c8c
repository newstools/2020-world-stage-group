The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has warned Independent Petroleum Marketers (IPMAN) in Osun against exploiting motorists in the sales of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS). Mr Olusegun Daboh, the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) Operations Controller in the state, gave the warning on Friday in Osogbo when he received the newly elected IPMAN Executives. Daboh said the department would continue to monitor all filling stations in the state to ensure that they dispense accurately. The controller said any marketer caught under-dispensing product would have their filling stations sealed, and pay N100, 000 as fine on each pump discovered to be under-dispensing product. He described as disheartening the way some independent marketers engage in sharp practices, adding that the DPR would not relent in its surveillance operations in the state. Daboh, however, assured them of necessary support to succeed and advised them to always abide by all precautionary regulations. Also speaking, Mr Femi Ogunmuyiwa, DPR Headâ€™s of Operations, appealed to the marketers to always train their attendants on safety practices. Ogunmuyiwa noted that some of the attendants lack requisite knowledge on safety procedure involved in the sales of oil and gas. Earlier, Alhaji Bukola Mati, the IPMAN Chairman, solicited for the support of DPR for the new executives and the association at large. Mati said support of the DPR was necessary for their business to thrive.
