WorldStage Newsonline– The Nigerian government has agreed to lift the ban placed on Emirates Airlines from operating into and out of the country based on undertaking by authorities of the United Arabs Emirates (UAE). The Minister of Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, said in a statement signed by Mr James Odaudu Director of Public Affairs, in the ministry that the commencement of the airline’s operations would, however, depend on the commencement of visa issuance by the UAE. “UAE has written to state that they agree to issue visas to Nigerians, consequently decision has been reached to allow Emirates to fly into Nigeria with commencement of the Visa issuance as condition precedent. “ Please bear with this unusual situation, “ the minister said. Sirika appreciated the understanding of everyone who had been negatively affected by the recent policy decisions which forbade some airlines from operating into the country when Nigeria reopened its air space to international flights. According to him, the decisions were taken to protect the interests of the nation and its citizens who deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, same Nigeria treats other nationals. “It will be recalled that Emirates Airlines was initially given approval to operate into the country, an approval which was withdrawn following inability of Nigerians to obtain/use valid tourist visas to enter UAE,” he added.
